The primary strategy for influenza vaccine development is to elicit antibodies specific for the envelope glycoproteins of influenza virus. However, influenza virus causes high mutation rates, resulting in the emergence of new viral serotypes that are resistant to antibodies. T lymphocytes have been reported to be capable of mediating heterosubtypic protection through recognition of internal, more conserved, influenza virus proteins. Here, we demonstrate that influenza virus-specific CD8 T cells and virus-specific non-neutralizing antibodies cooperatively elicit protective immunity. Our data suggests that an influenza vaccine capable of eliciting both CD8 T cells and antibodies specific for highly conserved influenza proteins may be able to provide protection in humans."

Infection with L. major causes a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, from a mild form to a deadly form. While the causes of disease remain unknown, a host response to infection with L. major is thought to play an important role in the disease process. In this study, we used a mouse model of leishmaniasis to investigate what cytokines contribute to increased pathology when IL-10-mediated regulation is absent. We found that mice lacking IL-10 expression develop larger lesions than controls, but fewer parasites. Surprisingly, we found that IL-17, a cytokine that promotes inflammation, is also involved in increased pathology. IL-17 was found to regulate the IL-17 response and the production of IL-17 by immune cells from leishmaniasis patients. Thus, IL-17 may be a useful target for controlling immunopathology in leishmaniasis."

Here, we address this question by studying the process of adaptation in Drosophila melanica and D. robusta species groups, which have independently formed sex chromosomes. Each species has evolved a complex of 13 genes that function to compensate for the lack of genes on the other sex chromosome in both species. These genes recognize a conserved binding motif, which is enriched on the X chromosome. We infer that the diverse mutations that have evolved to compensate for the absence of genes on the other sex chromosome have taken different paths in each species. However, the propensity to use the same mutational pathway differs between independently formed X chromosomes and appears to be contingent on genomic properties of each species. This establishes the \u201cgenomic environment\u201d as an important determinant in predicting the outcome of evolutionary adaptations."

Yeast prions are unique among model organisms in that they can be replicated in the absence of host cell machinery, and they can be propagated in a test tube by controlled temperatures. Yeast prions contain a domain rich in glutamine ( Q ) and asparagine ( N ), which have the potential to facilitate the propagation of the infectious aggregates that are formed. We have identified 11 proteins with Q/N-rich domains that can promote the de novo aggregation of the Sup35 protein into the [PSI+] prion state. Here, we show that overexpression of many of the same 11 Q/N-rich proteins can also destabilize pre-existing [PSI+] or [URE3] prions. We explore in detail the mechanism by which the [PSI+] protein overexpression leads to the loss of [PSI+]. We show that the [PSI+] protein overexpression triggers the separation of Hsp104 and Sis1 chaperones from the diffuse cytoplasmic pool. Thus, a mechanism by which heterologous Q/N-rich proteins interfere with prion propagation appears to be the loss of cytoplasmic Hsp104 and Sis1 chaperones available to sever [PSI+]."

Previous studies have shown that Kcnq1 is imprinted in the heart, but the effect of tissue-specific loss of imprinting on this gene, as well as the role of Kcnq1 in heart development, has remained unknown. Here, we show that tissue-specific loss of imprinting affects expression of Kcnq1 in the heart. This effect is independent of Kcnq1 expression, as the expression of the paternally expressed Kcnq1 is unaffected by tissue-specific loss of Kcnq1ot1. We also find that, unlike in the mammalian genome, Kcnq1ot1 expression in the heart is established and maintained independently of Kcnq1 expression, thus excluding a role for Kcnq1ot1 in repressing Kcnq1. Surprisingly, we find that Kcnq1ot1 itself switches to biallelic expression specifically in the heart, suggesting that tissue-specific loss of imprinting may be common during embryogenesis. We also find that in later developmental stages, however, Kcnq1ot1 has a role in modulating Kcnq1 levels, such that its absence leads to overexpression of Kcnq1. Thus, our studies reveal novel mechanisms within the Kcnq1 imprinted domain that operate exclusively in the heart on Kcnq1."

We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic effects, we find evidence for strong evidence for great variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacements. In both populations, the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection coefficients. Specifically, we predict 27\u201329% of amino acid changing ( nonsynonymous ) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral, 30\u201342% are moderately deleterious, and nearly all the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal.

In fact, they are associated with the development of cardiomyopathies, a group of disorders characterized by progressive heart failure. Understanding the cellular-molecular substrates of heart disease is key to the development of cardiac specific therapies and to the prevention of off-target effects by non-cardiac targeted drugs. One of the primary targets for therapeutic intervention is the human ether a go-go ( hERG ) K+ channel, which, together with the KCNQ channel, controls the rate and efficiency of repolarization in human heart cells. Here, we show that, in Drosophila, mutations in or cardiac knockdown of Seizure ( Se ), along with KCNQ, both contribute significantly to adult heart function as they do in humans. In humans, mutations in Se and KCNQ cause severe arrhythmias, which are similar to those observed in humans. In contrast to KCNQ, however, mutations in Se also cause extensive structural remodeling of the myofibrillar organization, which suggests that hERG channel function has a novel link to sarcomeric and myofibrillar integrity."

In this study, we investigated the role of the CD4 CD8 T cell subset, a well-characterized component of the immune response that is responsible for the regulation of the immune system. We found that CD4 CD8 T cells, a subset of which are highly enriched in IBD, are highly specific for the human intestinal microbiota and function as potent inducers of regulatory T cells, which have the potential to control or prevent the detrimental effects of inflammatory bowel disease. Strikingly, we found that the specific regulatory T cells of IBD patients fail to respond to the common human intestinal bacteria, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and that these patients are unable to control IBD symptoms. Together, our data reveal that CD4 CD8 T cells are an important component of the human immune system and that they function to prevent IBD symptoms by regulating the human microbiota."

Cc is a small, soluble, highly-conserved electron carrier protein that coordinates the electron flow among different redox partners. Starting from the structures of individual proteins, we performed extensive conformational sampling of the ET-competent binding geometries, mapping out functional epitopes in the Cc complexes, estimating the upper limit of the ET rate in a given system, assessing ET properties of different binding stoichiometries, and gauging the effect of domain mobility on the intermolecular ET.

The physiological action of insulin is to stimulate glucose uptake and thereby reduce blood glucose. Insulin is also secreted by other cell types. While insulin is secreted from the pancreas, the pancreas is a major endocrine organ involved in the regulation of glucose and insulin secretion. There is evidence that insulin secretion can be regulated by 5-HT, a neurotransmitter that regulates glucose release from the brain. However, the mechanism of action of 5-HT on insulin secretion remains unclear. Using mice selectively deficient in 5-HT receptor, we show that 5-HT regulates insulin secretion by controlling the stability and activation of insulin receptors. We also show that 5-HT can regulate insulin secretion by coupling its action with a second receptor, which is known as serotonylation. Serotonylation is a posttranslational modification that can regulate signaling within a receptor-independent signaling mechanism. We also show that 5-HT can inactivate the Rab3a-Rab27a pathway, which is known to be involved in the inhibition of serotonylation. We also show that the loss of serotonylation of Rab3a in pancreatic \u03b2-cells causes the inhibition of insulin secretion. Our results suggest that 5-HT regulates insulin secretion by controlling the stability and activation of insulin receptors and, in doing so, also by modulating the action of other endocrine regulators."

Data from the National Sleeping Sickness Control Programme, Non-Governmental Organizations, and research institutions are analysed in this paper to update 2016 for these indicators, and to assess the epidemiological situation. Trends for the two primary indicators are on track for the 2020 goal: 2, 164 cases of HAT were reported in 2016 ( as compared to the milestone of 4, 000 cases ), and for the period 2012\u20132016 280, 000 km2 are estimated to be at moderate risk or higher ( i. e. \u2265 1 case/10, 000 people/year ), as compared to the milestone of 230, 000 km2.

A common subtype of congenital sideroblastic anemia is due to mutations in the SLC25A38 gene. The current treatment for SLC25A38 congenital sideroblastic anemia is chronic blood transfusion coupled with iron chelation. Here, we show that the SLC25A38 protein, and its yeast homolog Hem25, are mitochondrial glycine transporters required for the initiation of heme synthesis. To do so, we took advantage of the fact that mitochondrial glycine has several roles beyond the synthesis of heme, including the synthesis of folate derivatives through the glycine cleavage system. We identified that high levels of exogenous glycine, or 5-aminolevulinic acid ( 5-Ala ) a metabolite downstream of Hem25 in heme biosynthetic pathway, were able to restore heme levels to normal in yeast cells lacking Hem25 function. While neither glycine nor 5-Ala could ameliorate SLC25A38 congenital sideroblastic anemia in a zebrafish model, we determined that the addition of folate with glycine was able to restore hemoglobin levels. Given the tolerability of glycine and folate in humans, this study points to a potential novel treatment for SLC25A38 congenital sideroblastic anemia."

We isolated an intermediate V. cholerae strain that carries two different CTX phages that encode El Tor and classical cholera toxin. We show that the intermediate strain can be converted into various El Tor strains by recombination with the new CTX phages.

The cytological manifestations of recombination are called chiasmata, and they provide the physical link between the homologs. We have studied mouse HFM1, a member of the HFM1/Mer3 protein family. We have shown that Hfm1 is required for the normal progression of recombination and proper synapsis between homologous chromosomes. Chromosome localization of MSH4 is altered in the absence of Hfm1, and MLH1foci are drastically reduced.

Incubation of Brugia with Cx. p. pipiens midgut extracts produces similar internal damage phenotypes; indicating that the Cx. p. pipiens midgut factor ( s ) that damage mf in vivo are soluble and stable in physiological buffer, and inflict damage on mf in vitro."

Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) in microbial organisms have the potential to improve the way we understand, manage, and treat infectious diseases. However, existing GWAS methods are only able to perform limited analysis of the variation in a population genome. In this paper, we introduce a new phylogenetic approach that has been tailored for microbial GWAS, which is applicable to organisms ranging from purely clonal to frequently recombining. Our approach is robust to the confounding effects of both population structure and recombination, while maintaining high statistical power to detect associations. Thorough testing via application to simulated data provides strong support for the power and specificity of our approach and demonstrates the advantages offered over alternative clustering and dimension-reduction methods. We also illustrate the versatility and potential of our method, demonstrating the ability to identify both well-characterised and novel drivers of invasive disease. Our method is implemented as an open-source R package that is freely available at https://github. com/metrixwAS."

The disease is transmitted to humans via sandflies, and it is considered to be a potentially deadly zoonosis. Arginase 1 ( arg1 ) is a critical enzyme in the Leishmania parasite life cycle, and its expression is increased in the presence of anti-leishmanial drugs, suggesting that it is a target for drug development. We previously found that IL-4, a key cytokine in the parasite life cycle, is required for the induction of arg1 expression in macrophages. To better understand the mechanism of arg1 induction, we screened a panel of growth factor inhibitors and found that inhibition of growth factor signaling reduced arg1 expression in infected macrophages, and that this process was dependent on IL-4. Recombinant FGF-2 and IGF-1 increased the expression of arg1 in infected macrophages, and this induction was augmented by IL-4. Inhibition of the downstream signaling molecules JAK and AKT also reduced the activation of STAT6 in infected macrophages. Our data demonstrate that the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 ( FGF-2 ) and Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor ( IGF-1R ) and IL-4 signaling pathways converge at STAT6 to promote the pathologic arg1 expression and intracellular survival in VL. Targeted interruption of these pathological processes offers an approach to restrain this relentlessly progressive disease."

However, few epidemiological studies have been conducted to assess the health risks or protection effects associated with the use of this water source. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether access to rainwater cisterns is associated with the decrease in the prevalence of Giardia duodenalis infections in children, compared to other children living in households supplied by other water supplies. A quasi-experimental study was developed in two rural municipalities of the semiarid region of Brazil. A sample of 664 children aged between 4 months and 5 years old were followed up, of which 332 had access to rainwater cisterns ( cistern group ) and 332 did not, having water supplied from alternative sources ( comparison group ). In a period of approximately one year ( 2010 ) intestinal parasites were investigated in feces of children from the cistern group. The prevalence of G. duodenalis in children from the cistern group ranged from 4. 8 to 10. 5%, while the prevalence in the comparison group ranged from 7. 6 to 16. 7%. Multivariate analysis ( GEE ) showed a higher risk of G. duodenalis infection in children who did not have access to rainwater cisterns, when compared to children who did. The other variables associated with G. duodenalis infection were: number of rooms per house ( OR 0. 89; 95% CI 1. 17\u20132. 51 ) ; family income ( OR0. 48; 95% CI 0. 26\u20130. 88 ) ; preterm children ( OR 1. 70; 95% CI 1. 19\u20132. 43 ) ; and improper hand hygiene prior to food preparation ( OR 4. 78; 95% CI 1. 95\u201311. 76 ).

MBL levels and activity are affected by genetic polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene. We sequenced the MBL2 promoter and exon 1 in 196 chronic CD patients and 202 controls. The MBL2*C allele, which causes MBL deficiency, was associated with protection against CD ( P = 0. 007, OR = 0. 32 ). Compared with controls, genotypes with this allele were completely absent in patients with the cardiac form of the disease. Furthermore, cardiac patients with genotypes causing MBL deficiency presented less heart damage, compared with cardiac patients having the XA haplotype causing low MBL levels, but fully capable of activating complement. Among the patients, those with alleles causing MBL deficiency presented lower levels of cytokines and chemokines possibly implicated in symptom development. These findings suggest a protective effect of genetically determined MBL deficiency against the development and progression of chronic CD cardiomyopathy."

We also predicted two interesting characteristics regarding cell infection patterns: stochastic variation among cells in the number of viral genomes that establish infection and stochastic inequality in the accumulation of their progenies in each cell. We confirmed both characteristics experimentally, demonstrating the robustness of the model to changes in the parameter values, suggesting that other viruses could adopt similar adaptation mechanisms.

We demonstrate that perceptual integration initiates robust and rapid responses along the dorsal visual pathway in a hierarchical manner, faster than the ventral pathway. Specifically, the anterior intraparietal sulcus ( IPS ) responds first ( i. e., within 100 ms ), followed by activities backpropagating along the dorsal pathway to early visual areas ( EVAs ). The IPS-to-EVA response profile fails to appear when the global form could not be perceived. Our results support the crucial function of the dorsal visual pathway in perceptual integration by quickly extracting a coarse global template ( i. e., an initial object representation ) within first 100 ms to guide subsequent local sensory processing so that the ambiguities in the visual inputs can be efficiently resolved."

We show that voltage-dependent activation is essentially governed by two separable voltage-dependent steps followed by voltage-independent opening of the pore. According to this model analysis, the binding of cAMP to the channels exerts multiple effects on the voltage-dependent gating: It stabilizes the open pore, reduces the total gating charge from ~8 to ~5, makes an additional closed state outside the activation pathway accessible and strongly accelerates the ON-gating but not the OFF-gating. Furthermore, the open channel has a much slower computed OFF-gating current than the closed channel, in both the absence and presence of cAMP.

Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ), a herpesvirus associated with several human malignancies, can cause severe disease in humans. The virus reprograms the host immune response by activating cellular receptors involved in recognition of viral elements. TLRs sense viral infection and activate host antiviral immune responses. We have previously shown that TLRs are subject to regulation by ubiquitination, a process in which proteins are conjugated to cellular receptors. Ubiquitination controls activation of TLRs, which is critical to the early innate immune response. Here, we have investigated how EBV suppresses TLR signaling. We show that the large tegument protein BPLF1, a component of the EBV particle, acts as a functional deubiquitinase and suppresses activation of TLRs. This results in reduced activation of NF-\u03baB, a critical antiviral immune response gene. Our results show that EBV uses deubiquitination to counteract innate immune responses."

Yersinia virulence factor Y ( YopM ) is a crucial virulence factor of the Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic plague. YopM enters the nucleus of host cells and can interact with the cellular factors to affect the host cell physiology. In this work we show that YopM interacts with the cellular factor DDX3. We also provide the structure of the YopM:DDX3 complex. Our results suggest that the interaction of YopM with DDX3 determines the extent of phosphorylation of RSK1 in the nucleus to control transcription of immunosuppressive cytokines."

These morphological changes alter host-microbe interactions, and are critical for pathogenesis. While some fungi switch to a yeast form, others switch to a filamentous form. This switch is critical for fungal pathogenicity, but whether this morphological change contributes to virulence is unclear. Here, we use the human fungal pathogen Mucor circinelloides to show that the calcineurin pathway plays key roles in the transition between yeast and filamentous forms. In the presence of the calcineurin inhibitor FK506, Mucor exhibits exclusively multi-budded yeast growth. We also show that the calcineurin pathway is required for hyphal growth and encodes a novel calcineurin regulatory subunit. Disruption of the cnbR gene encoding the sole calcineurin B subunit resulted in a series of mutant strains, each lacking the only calcineurin B subunit. Furthermore, the cnaA mutant is hypersensitive to calcineurin inhibitors and produces a mixture of yeast and hyphae in aerobic culture. The cnaA mutant also produces spores that are larger than wild-type, and spore size is correlated with virulence potential. Our results demonstrate that the calcineurin pathway orchestrates the yeast-hyphal and spore size dimorphic transitions that contribute to virulence of this common zygomycete fungal pathogen."

Moreover, ubiquitylation of STAT6 is dramatically associated with the increased ubiquitylated form of tripartite motif family like 2 ( TRIML2 ) for prolonged cell survival and virion production, which is also commonly observed in lytic activation of EBV, KSHV and cytomegalovirus.

We show that each of these transcription factors has a complex regulatory network that has been massively reshaped in cis and trans. While the transcription factors in both species are able to activate genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and function, the general transcription factors in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans do not have a similar function in controlling ribosomal gene expression, but instead activate ribosomal genes and rDNA expression. We show that these changes occurred in transcription factor wiring with cellular functions, movements in transcription factor hierarchies, DNA-binding specificity, and regulatory complexes assembly to promote global changes in the architecture of the fungal transcriptional regulatory network."

Our results provide novel insight into the mechanism of olfaction in An. gambiae.

Although Fgf23 is known to be responsible for hypophosphatemia and reduced vitamin D hormone levels in Hyp mice, its putative role as an auto-/paracrine osteomalacia-causing factor has not been explored. We recently reported that Fgf23 is a suppressor of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase ( Tnap ) transcription via FGF receptor-3 ( FGFR3 ) signaling, leading to inhibition of mineralization through accumulation of the TNAP substrate pyrophosphate. Here, we report that the pyrophosphate concentration is increased in Hyp bones, and that Tnap expression is decreased in Hyp-derived osteocyte-like cells but not in Hyp-derived osteoblasts. Blocking of increased Fgf23-FGFR3 signaling with anti-Fgf23 antibodies or an FGFR3 inhibitor partially restored the suppressed TNAP activity, phosphate production, and mineralization in Hyp mice. Moreover, treatment of wild-type osteoblasts or mice with recombinant FGF23 suppressed T Nap-related TNAP activity and increased pyrophosphate concentrations. In conclusion, we have identified a novel mechanism contributing to the mineralization defect in Hyp mice."

Here we investigate a different benefit: immunity to disease, which is termed concomitant immunity, or premunition. We show that in the protozoan parasite Leishmania major, premunition does not exclude transmission of the original infecting organism. Indeed, we show that super-infection, which would favor transmission of the original infecting organism, can be achieved with minimal pathology. This finding has important consequences to the maintenance and generation of parasite diversity in the natural Leishmania infectious cycle alternating between mammalian and sand fly hosts."

Here we introduce a novel approach to the reconstruction of the gait dynamics from human walking patterns, specifically from dynamic patterns that emerge from the local state-of-the-art pattern recognition system. Our approach effectively maintains the intrinsic dynamics and subtle synchronization patterns from the original dynamics, and thus facilitates a quantitative and accurate characterization of the dynamics over traditional methods. Application to human gait data for healthy subjects and diabetics reveals a significant difference in the dynamics of ankle movements and ankle-knee coordination, but not in knee movements.

Culex pipiens was the dominant species except in four villages where An. maculipennis s. l. and Cx. torrentium were predominant. There was a significant positive correlation between the density of Cx. pipiens and electrical conductivity, alkalinity, total hardness and chloride, whereas no significant negative correlation was observed between physicochemical factors and larval density. The highest interspecific correlation coefficient was observed between An. maculipennis s. l/An. hyrcanus and An. hyrcanus/An. pseudopictus. The correlations observed between physicochemical factors and larval density, can possibly confirm the effect of these parameters on the breeding activities of mosquitoes, and may be indicative of the presence of certain mosquito fauna in a given region."

In humans, the parasite eggs are trapped in the liver and the cysts mainly in the lung. After ingestion, the larvae release the eggs into the environment. Sheep are a natural host of the parasite. They can be infected with E. granulosus and the larvae can develop into cysts. The infective larvae are then transmitted to humans through the bite of an infective fly. The larvae of sheep are highly susceptible to the human antiparasitic drug praziquantel. The efficacy of praziquantel against sheep larval stage E. granulosus is low and the parasite is easily killed with a single dose of praziquantel. However, the high dose of praziquantel, which is used for many years, has a high cost and requires multiple injections. Therefore, we have studied the efficacy of high dose of praziquantel, praziquantel and high dose of praziquantel in sheep with 92 randomly selected sheep. We found that praziquantel and praziquantel were effective schemas that can be added to control measures in animals and merits further study for the treatment of animal CE."

Overexpression of RTKs is associated with a number of human cancers. Therefore, understanding how these signalling pathways are regulated can provide important information for the design of therapies that target RTK signalling. Here, we used the RTKs RET and EGFR to investigate how the FAK kinase regulates receptor recycling into the plasma membrane. FAK suppressed receptor recycling in the plasma membrane, which resulted in lower receptor-mediated signalling. Conversely, increasing the plasma membrane pool of the receptors increased receptor-mediated signalling. These data suggest FAK as a suppressor of RTK signalling in both Drosophila melanogaster epithelia and MDA-MB-231 human cancer cells."

However, these methods often predict the same targets, which suggests that they may be inaccurate. Here we describe a method that combines expression data from human and mouse to identify conserved patterns of expression between orthologous miRNAs and mRNA genes. Our method allowed us to predict thousands of putative miRNA targets. We confirmed 4 of 6 predictions. In addition, we predicted many miRNAs that act as expression enhancers. We show that many miRNA enhancer effects are mediated through the repression of negative transcriptional regulators and that this effect could be as common as the widely reported repression activity of miRNAs. Our findings suggest that the indirect enhancement of gene expression by miRNAs could be an important component of miRNA regulation that has been widely neglected to date."

They alternate between an extracellular stage in the insect vector and an intracellular stage in the mammalian host. The former stage, the amastigote, proliferates in macrophages of the mammalian host and causes severe pathology in humans, while the latter stage, the amastigote, proliferates inside macrophages of the mammalian host and causes cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, two major health problems worldwide. Stage-specific alterations in metabolism and gene expression are known to be important for parasite survival and adaptation to these environments. However, how these alterations affect parasite physiology is poorly understood. We show that the differentiation of the amastigote stage is accompanied by changes in metabolism. We show that catabolism of hexose and fatty acids provides a C4 dicarboxylic acid ( succinate/malate ) and acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of glutamate via a compartmentalized mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle. In vitro differentiated amastigotes are acutely sensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial aconitase and glutamine synthetase, indicating that these anabolic pathways are essential for intracellular growth and virulence. Induction of a stringent metabolic response may facilitate amastigote survival in a nutrient-poor intracellular niche and underlie the increased dependence of this stage on hexose and mitochondrial metabolism."

This observation is general and robust to parameter choice by developing a systems-level sensitivity analysis technique, and we extended this analysis to generate other parameter-independent, experimentally testable hypotheses. Lastly, we leveraged this model as an in silico test bed to evaluate potential strategies for engineering cell-based therapies to overcome tumor associated immune dysfunction and thereby identified modes of immune modulation predicted to be most effective.

Derlin-1 binds to TER94 directly, and this interaction is essential for Derlin-1 overexpression to suppress the pathogenic TER94-induced neurodegeneration. Derlin-1 overexpression reduces the elevated ATPase activity of pathogenic TER94, implying that IBMPFD is caused by ATPase hyper-activation. Under physiological condition, Derlin-1 expression is increased upon ER stress to recruit TER94 to the ER. However, in response to severe ER stress, Derlin-1 is required for activating apoptosis to eliminate damaged cells. This pro-apoptotic response is mimicked by Derlin-1 overexpression, which elicits apoptosis via a novel C-terminal motif ( \u03b1 ). As this Derlin-1-dependent cell death is negated by TER94 overexpression, we propose that, while Derlin-1 and VCP work cooperatively in ER stress response, their imbalance has a role in removing cells suffering prolonged ER stress."

Remarkably, we observed a doubling of chromosome complements when degron alleles of the RSC subunit SFH1, the yeast hSNF5 tumor suppressor ortholog, and RSC3 were combined. The requirement for simultaneous deregulation of SFH1 and RSC3 to induce these ploidy shifts was eliminated by knockout of the S-phase cyclin CLB5 and by transient depletion of replication origin licensing factor Cdc6p. Further, combination of the degron alleles of SFH1 and RSC3, with deletion alleles of each of the nine Cdc28/Cdk1-associated cyclins, revealed a strong and specific genetic interaction between the S-phase cyclins CLB5 and RSC3, indicating a role for RSC-mediated chromatin remodeling in ploidy maintenance.

Furthermore, we show that the replication stress-induced apoptosis pathway does not depend on ATM or its downstream effector p53 and that the Chk1-suppressed pathway protects cells from DNA replication stress-induced apoptosis. Our results show that the Chk1-suppressed pathway plays a major role in the regulation of death in response to DNA replication stress and that the Chk1-suppressed pathway protects cells from DNA replication stress-induced apoptosis."

Cysts are not observed in Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite that causes diarrhea and liver fluke disease in humans. The reason for this lack of cysts is unknown, but is likely to involve the host immune response. Cellular stress may also play a role. We have recently shown that certain divalent cations, such as hydrogen peroxide, can induce encystment in vitro in the presence of trace amounts of several cations. We show here that the presence of trace amounts of several cations, in the presence of trace amounts of hydrogen peroxide, transform into small sized spherical and refringent structures that exhibit resistance to different detergents. The results presented here suggest that induction of encystment can be achieved in vitro by exposure to different detergents. As a first step in developing new drugs, we have characterized the structural components of the cyst wall of E. histolytica and show that N-acetylglucosamine ( chitin ) is the primary component of the natural cyst walls. We also show that a mutation in the gene encoding for glucosamine 6-phosphate isomerase, likely to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the chitin synthesis pathway, was confirmed by RT-PCR."

Within macrophages, F. tularensis replicates in close association with the host RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) complex, which is composed of three transcription factors that regulate virulence gene expression. These three factors form a complex with RNA polymerase, but only one of them, PigR, is found at virtually all genes. Here we show that PigR is found at virtually all genes in F. tularensis. Furthermore, we find that the ability of PigR to associate with the RNAP complex is dependent upon the presence of the DNA-binding motif present in the promoters of virulence genes. Our results reveal how transcription factors can exert regulatory effects at a restricted set of promoters despite being associated with most or all. This distinction may be relevant to the study of RNAP-associated transcription regulators in other pathogenic bacteria."

Genome-wide association studies have identified many genetic variants that increase or decrease the risk of developing RA. In some cases, however, the genetic variants themselves are not known to cause RA. Such variants are termed causal variants and are often thought to affect the function of a gene. We have previously shown that CCR6, a gene involved in the immune response, is likely causal because the CCR6 gene is altered by a genetic variant known as CCR6DNP. To further understand the role of CCR6DNP in RA, we used a novel assay to identify a protein called PARP-1 that is associated with CCR6DNP. We found that manipulating PARP-1 activity impairs CCR6 expression. This work identifies PARP-1 as a novel gene whose function is regulated by CCR6DNP, and introduces a novel and highly efficient assay for the identification of causal genetic variants."

Such assembly is thought to be guided by the multitude of proteins involved in transcription. Here we show that a model of transcription that integrates the presence of transcription factor complexes on chromatin and the presence of chromatin modifications appears to be in excellent accordance with the experimental observations.

To investigate the relationship between ECM genes and poor prognosis in breast cancer, expression quantitative trait locus analysis of polyoma middle-T transgene-induced mammary tumor was performed. ECM gene expression was found to be consistently associated with Rrp1b expression. Furthermore, a gene signature induced by ectopic expression of Rrp1b in tumor cells predicted survival in a human breast cancer gene expression dataset.

While hybridization with C. grandiflora pollen donors was entirely or nearly completely abrogated by endosperm cellization, the reciprocal hybridization was benign to plants and resulted in the formation of small seeds with precociously cellularized endosperm. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that both hybridization species exhibited unbalanced gene expression profiles, which mimics the response of paternal and maternal hybridization in Arabidopsis. Our data support the theory that the evolutionary barriers between the species differ in their genetic interaction and in their genome architecture, and provide strong support for the idea that the non-reciprocal endosperm barriers in plants of different mating systems are established by a fast evolving mechanism."

This study uncovers the co-circulation of several Africa-1 and Africa-2 lineages in the southern regions of Cameroon.

Here, we employ a two-component whole-cell multiscale framework to predict the static and dynamic responses of RBCs subject to tensile forcing, using only experimental information on the structural defects in the lipid bilayer, cytoskeleton, and their interaction. We first employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics ( CGMD ) on a small RBC patch to compute the shear modulus, bending stiffness, and network parameters, which are subsequently used to predict the RBC shape and corresponding stress field. For Pf-RBCs at trophozoite and schizont stages, the presence of cytoadherent knobs elevates the shear response in the lipid bilayer and stiffens the RBC membrane. For RBCs in spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, the bilayer-cytoskeleton interaction is weakened, resulting in substantial increase of the tensile stress in the lipid bilayer. Furthermore, we investigate the transient behavior of stretching deformation and shape relaxation of the normal and defective RBCs. Our results provide fundamental insights into the microstructure and biomechanics of RBCs, and demonstrate that the two-step multiscale framework presented here can be used effectively for in silico studies of hematological disorders based on first principles and patient-specific experimental input at the protein level."

Further, our results show that mitochondrial polyadenylation does not regulate mRNA stability but protects the 3' terminal integrity, and that despite a lack of functioning 3' ends, these trimmed transcripts are translated, suggesting that polyadenylation is not required for mitochondrial translation. Additionally, loss of MTPAP leads to reduced steady-state levels and disturbed maturation of tRNACys, indicating that polyadenylation in mitochondria might be important for the stability and maturation of specific tRNAs."

MicroRNAs are involved in gene silencing and have been shown to be involved in a wide range of developmental and cellular processes. MicroRNAs regulate gene expression through binding to complementary sequences in the messenger RNAs of their target genes. The binding sites of microRNAs are often reported in the literature. In this paper, we describe a novel computational system that is able to extract miRNA-gene and miRNA-gene relations. We then performed the analysis of the results on a large number of abstracts obtained from published literature, as well as the results from recent microarray experiments. The results obtained show that our system can be used to extract the miRNA-gene and miRNA-gene relations. Our results also show that our system is able to identify genes potentially regulated by microRNAs. We used the results obtained by our system to analyze the expression profile of genes in triple negative breast cancer and to identify potential miRNA targets."

The IAV virus replicates in a late endosomal pathway that is acidified and penetrates the cytoplasm of host cells. In this process, IAV enters the nucleus and induces transcriptional changes that help to reorganize the nucleus. This process requires the reorganization of the microtubule ( MT ) cytoskeleton and the microtubule ( MT ) cytoskeleton to create a novel membrane-bound structure, the endocytic organelle, the centrosome. We show that histone deacetylase 8 ( HDAC8 ), a cytoplasmic enzyme, is important for this process. Depletion of HDAC8 caused loss of centrosome cohesion, disrupted the microtubule organization, and enhanced infection of the cell. HDAC1, on the other hand, promoted infection of Uukuniemi virus ( a bunyavirus ). Our results suggest that HDACs are important regulators of influenza virus infection and other late penetrating viruses."

Combining computational data analysis and experimental verification, we have identified 726 deletions in the human lineage, and 660 deletions in the chimpanzee lineage. The ARMD events essentially counteract the genomic expansion caused by chimpanzee-specific Alu inserts. The RefSeq databases indicate that 13 exons in six genes, annotated as either demonstrably or putatively functional in the human genome, and 299 intronic regions have been deleted through ARMDs in the chimpanzee lineage.

T. cruzi infection is characterized by an impairment of the peripheral immune system, as evidenced by the lack of CD4+ T cells and their effector functions. We previously demonstrated that T. cruzi infection induces an impairment of the Th1-like T cell compartment, a population that is crucial for the generation of T helper type 1 cytokines and for the development of T cell regulatory functions. In this study, we investigated the effect of T. cruzi infection upon the T cell regulatory compartment. We confirmed that T. cruzi infection induces a marked loss of T cell regulatory cell number associated to cell precursor exhaustion, partially avoided by glucocorticoid ablation- and IL-2 survival factor depletion. At the same time, we observed alterations in the T cell regulatory compartment. Moreover, we found that tTregs accumulate within the CD4 single-positive compartment, enhancing after the infection the expression of signature markers ( CD25, CD62L and GITR ) and they also displaying alterations in the expression of migration-associated molecules ( \u03b1 chains of VLAs and chemokine receptors ). Our data indicate that the evident loss of T cell regulatory cell number may compromise the composition of T cell regulatory compartment, and such alterations over time may be partially related to the immune dysregulation observed in the chronic phase of the disease."

The virus can be reactivated and multiply, a process that leads to the production of new virus particles. The pattern of viral gene expression is a key determinant of viral persistence and reactivation. We have recently developed a method to identify the integration site of the viral genome in the HTLV-1 infection. Here, we used this method to test two major predictions. First, that the viral integrations are associated with the expression of the viral gene product, proviral gene. Second, that the orientation of the provirus relative to its host gene determines proviral gene expression and in vivo clonal abundance. We found that integration targeting is strongly associated with the presence of a binding site for host transcription factors, especially for the transcription factor STAT1. The presence of the chromatin remodelling factors BRG1 and INI1 and certain host transcription factors either upstream or downstream of the provirus were strongly associated with silencing or spontaneous expression of the provirus. Cells expressing HTLV-1 Tax protein were significantly more frequent in clones of low abundance in vivo. We conclude that transcriptional interference and chromatin remodelling are critical determinants of proviral latency in natural HTLV-1 infection."

Our method can be used to classify whether a cell is oscillatory or non-oscillatory. We show that our method outperforms the peak-to-peak variability of single-cell oscillations in the simulated data, and we apply it to experimental time series from a simple genetic oscillator model and a different gene expression profile ( such as those of a constitutive promoter and an oscillator ).

This analysis revealed two temporally distinct responses that could be separated into activation of NF\u03baB- and type I IFN-regulated genes.

ZIKVLPs formulated with alum were injected into 6-8-week-old interferon deficient mice as well as wild type BALB/c mice. Control mice received PBS/alum. Animals were challenged with 200 PFU ( >1000 AG129 LD50s ) of ZIKV strain H/PF/2013. All vaccinated mice survived with no morbidity or weight loss while control animals either died at 9 days post challenge ( AG129 ) or had increased viremia ( BALB/c ). We also demonstrate the protective efficacy of the ZIKVLP vaccine in mice. Our findings demonstrate the protective efficacy of the ZIKVLP vaccine and highlight the important role that neutralizing antibodies play in protection against ZIKV infection."

Dyslexia is a heterogeneous disorder, which is often caused by genetic mutations. Copy number variants ( CNVs ) are a large class of genetic mutations, which are thought to increase the impact of genetic mutations on disease severity. However, the impact of CNVs on disease severity is not well understood due to limited phenotypic and genotypic data. Here, we present data on the frequency and impact of CNVs on a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. We show that large CNVs are more common in individuals with intellectual disability ( ID ) and multiple congenital anomalies ( MCA ) compared to controls. We also show that the impact of CNVs on dyslexia severity is independent of autism and MCA. Our data provide new insight into the genetic basis of neurodevelopmental disorders."

Although it is known that STDP can be implemented both analytically and numerically, it is still unclear how these mechanisms are controlled so that they can generate stable, long-term changes in synaptic strength. We have previously shown that the time window of STDP is shaped by a pre- and postsynaptic firing rate fluctuation. Here we show that a small temporal shift in the STDP window causes synchronous or nearly synchronous action potentials to induce long-term depression. We also show that the strength of the pre- and postsynaptic inputs, and the Hebbian and anti-Hebbian forms of STDP, can be implemented with the same temporal shift in the pre- and postsynaptic firing rate. Interestingly, the level of inhibition determines whether plasticity is Hebbian or anti-Hebbian. Even a random symmetric jitter of a few milliseconds in the STDP window can stabilize synaptic strengths while retaining these features. The same results hold for a shifted version of the more recent \u201ctriplet\u201d model of STDP. Our results indicate that the detailed shape of the STDP window function near the transition from depression to potentiation is of the utmost importance in determining the consequences of STDP, suggesting that this region warrants further experimental study."

However, to date, RNAi studies in schistosome stages infecting humans have focused on single ( or up to 3 ) genes of interest. Therefore, in the context of standardizing RNAi screens, data are limited on the extent of possible off-targeting effects, gene-to-gene variability in RNAi efficiency and the operational capabilities and limits of RNAi. We investigated the sensitivity and selectivity of RNAi using double-stranded ( ds ) RNA ( approximately 500 bp ) designed to target 11 genes of Schistosoma mansoni. We employed a method of mechanical transformation, enabling us to screen parasites that are relevant to parasitism in humans, amenable to screen automation and easy to obtain in greater numbers than adult parasites. We found that RNAi was sensitive to the gene target ( s ) in the pools of transcripts representative of each tissue. The sensitivity of individual gene targets varied.

To understand the underlying biology of TFs we need to have a good understanding of how they function. One way to study these functions is to compare DNA sequences from multiple genes. One way to find groups of similar sequences is to find a motif ( i. e., a short DNA sequence pattern ) that is present in many genes. In this work we have focused on motifs that are not found in the gene of interest. We have developed a novel algorithm that can find motif families that are conserved across different species and that are not found in a motif of interest in a given gene. Our algorithm requires only the sequence of the motif of interest to be available, and can therefore be applied to a motif of interest in any gene. We have applied this algorithm to a set of TF motifs and have found that it is able to identify motif families that are conserved across different species and are not found in a motif of interest in a given gene. Our results show that the method can be used to find motif families that are specific to a gene, e. g., a DNA-binding motif is found only in a gene."

Many of these parasites possess unique life cycles that include both a lytic replicative stage and an asexual stage. Toxoplasma gondii, the most common human protozoan parasite, replicates a complex life cycle in both a lytic replicative form and an asexual, nonreplicative form. The completion of the lytic cycle requires that the parasite senses changes in its environment and switches between the non-motile ( for intracellular replication ) and motile ( for invasion and egress ) states appropriately. Although the signaling pathway that regulates the motile state switch is critical to the pathogenesis of these diseases, it is not well understood. Here we show that a novel protein, AKMT, which is involved in the regulation of the parasite cell polarity, controls the activation of the motility switch in Toxoplasma. AKMT reduces the rate of parasite motility and compromises parasite invasion and egress. Interestingly, AKMT redistributes rapidly from the parasite body to the apical complex, suggesting that AKMT regulation of parasite motility might be accomplished by the precise temporal control of its localization in response to environmental changes."

There is a longstanding question in neuroscience as to how the brain can recognize the pitch of complex sounds. One prevailing hypothesis posits the importance of the temporal pattern of the action potentials ( spikes ) of the peripheral auditory system. This theory predicts that the brain must be able to extract meaningful information from spike times. However, it is difficult to test such a hypothesis experimentally. Here, we describe a biophysical model of auditory processing that can explain the development of neural structures specialized in capturing synchronous or correlated activity from amongst neural events. We show that a correlation-based neural mechanism can explain the development of neural structures required for recognizing the pitch of simple sounds, with or without the fundamental frequency.

However, it remains unclear whether the beneficial effects of dietary restriction are due to specific neural mechanisms or whether the beneficial effects on learning are due to indirect or secondary consequences of improved health and extended lifespan.

Most cartilage, bone, and connective tissue of the head and face is derived from neural crest cells. Hence, congenital craniofacial anomalies are often attributed to defects in neural crest cell formation, survival, migration, or differentiation.

We show by biochemical and in vivo studies that Als interacts directly with Ter94, an AAA ATPase known to associate with E3 ligases and to drive protein turnover. We suggest that Als antagonizes Ter94's positive effect on E3 ligase function and propose that Als promotes Wg signaling by rescuing Arm from proteolytic degradation, spotlighting an unexpected step where the Wg pathway signal is modulated."

To address this issue, we developed the software Irisas to re qualifies and re-annotate these variants. We also integrated them to predict the functional impact of SNPs, INDELs, and structural variants for burden testing.

Our study examined the activation and function of neutrophils during acute episodes of malaria. We found that blood samples from malaria patients were highly activated, while those from healthy donors were not. We also found that neutrophils from malaria patients showed enhanced phagocytic activity and superoxide production, suggesting that neutrophils may be a good target for anti-malarial chemotherapy. Interestingly, neutrophils from malaria patients expressed high levels of G protein-coupled receptor ( GRK2 ), low levels of CXCR2, and displayed impaired chemotaxis towards IL-8 ( CXCL8 ). Our data suggest that neutrophils from malaria patients may be a poor source of pro-inflammatory cytokines and display reduced chemotactic activity, suggesting a possible mechanism for an enhanced susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection during malaria."

Approximately 19% of 14, 293 genes were identified as female genes. Many female genes have potential Caenorhabditis elegans homologues annotated as germline-, oogenesis-, spermatogenesis-, and early embryogenesis- enriched. Peptidase, ligase, transferase, regulator activity for kinase and transcription, and rRNA and lipid binding were associated with female reproduction. In contrast, catalytic activity from kinase, ATP, and carbohydrate binding were associated with male reproduction. Significantly enriched pathways in females were associated with cell growth and protein synthesis, whereas metabolic pathways such as pentose phosphate and energy production pathways were enriched in males. Many proteins encoded by female reproduction genes are secreted by Brugia malayi, and these encode immunomodulatory molecules such as antioxidants and host cytokine mimics. Our localization of reproduction genes in filarial reproductive organs supports the hypothesis that these genes encode proteins involved in reproduction."

The model predicts that changes in the trafficking of VEGF receptors, as well as changes in the strength of downstream effects, can account for differences in downstream signaling. We show that VEGF receptors are localized on the surface of endosomal cells differently, and that differences in their trafficking can be accounted for by changes in receptor activation.

Here, we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans mucin-like gene osm-8, which is critical for the regulation of osmolyte accumulation and activation of osmoresponsive gene expression, is also required for osmotic stress resistance. To identify genes required for osm-8 function, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen and identified 27 genes that when mutated disrupt osm-8 function. One of these genes, the transmembrane protein PTR-23, was previously identified as a novel transmembrane protein that negatively regulates osmolyte accumulation and activation of osmoresponsive gene expression. Our results suggest that the mucin-like protein, which is also known to control osmolyte accumulation and activate osmoresponsive gene expression, is also required for osmotic stress resistance. Given that mammalian and Drosophila mucins and transmembrane proteins are also critical regulators of osmotic stress response, our results suggest a possible evolutionarily conserved role for the mucin-plasma membrane interface in eukaryotic osmoregulation."

It rapidly evolves resistance to several classes of antifungal drugs, including the three major classes used in the clinic, amphotericin B ( AmB ). This has led to a longstanding conundrum in evolutionary biology: why do these three major classes have been so successful in the clinic for so many years? We investigated this question by studying the genomes of clinical isolates that had evolved resistance to AmB over the last 50 years. We identified the mutations that confer resistance simultaneously, and the costs that these mutations conferred. We found that resistance to AmB comes at a great cost: it limits the ability of the organism to survive in the presence of the drug. Our work provides a detailed example of how this evolutionary puzzle shapes the evolution of resistance to a major antifungal drug."

This is a critical step in the development of the disease, as a failure to replicate inside macrophages results in a variety of symptoms including pulmonary and systemic disease. To survive inside macrophages, the bacterium employs a variety of mechanisms to evade recognition by the macrophage. We have used a novel approach to identify small molecules that inhibit growth of the bacterium in macrophages. We have found that small molecules that modulate the function of host receptors restrict bacterial growth in macrophages, and also inhibit the growth of the bacterium in macrophages. We have validated our results using a mouse model of infection and have demonstrated that the growth inhibition of one of our compounds, gefitinib, is mediated through activation of a cellular signaling pathway. This pathway prevents macrophages from responding to infection. Our results support the concept that screening for inhibitors using intracellular models results in the identification of tools for probing pathways during in vivo infection and may also result in the identification of new anti-tuberculosis agents that work by modulating host pathways."

Current methods for the identification of putatively co-regulated genes directly from gene expression time profiles are based on the similarity of the time profiles. Such association metrics, despite their central role in gene network inference and machine learning, have largely ignored the impact of dynamics or variation in mRNA stability. Here we introduce a new similarity metric called lead-lag R2 that successfully accounts for the properties of gene dynamics, including varying mRNA degradation and delays. Using yeast cell-cycle time-series gene expression data, we demonstrate that the predictive power of lead-lag R2 for the identification of co-regulated genes is significantly higher than that of standard similarity measures, thus allowing the selection of a large number of entirely new putatively co-regulated genes. Furthermore, the lead-lag metric can also be used to uncover the relationship between gene expression time-series and the dynamics of formation of multiple protein complexes. Remarkably, we found a high lead-lag R2 value among genes coding for a transient complex."

In this study, we developed two new molecular approaches for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The first approach, LAMP, targets the Internal Transcribed Spacer ( ITS ) region of Histoplasma capsulatum, and the second, nested PCR, targets the conserved nuclease domain. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of these assays using 26 bone marrow and 5 whole blood samples from patients suspected to have histoplasmosis and 5 whole blood samples from healthy subjects. We found that the sensitivity of the two approaches was comparable, and both assays could be detected with high specificity. One important advantage of both assays is their ability to detect all clades of H. capsulatum. The ITS LAMP assay was shown to be suitable for the diagnosis of the clinically important form of the disease, which is characterized by severe pulmonary edema and disseminated symptoms. In addition, the results of the nested PCR assay showed that it could be used directly to crude whole blood specimens, without any need for DNA extraction, which makes it suitable for laboratories with limited resources."

CPV is endemic to the Americas and is transmitted to humans via infected animals. Although it is known that CPV is a parasite of carnivores, the origin of the virus is not known. Here, we have studied the evolution of CPV in carnivores by analyzing viruses isolated from the wild from different carnivore species. We have found that, like their feline counterpart, CPV is highly host-specific, and that the changes in the viral genome that result in this specificity are largely the same. We also show that the ability of the virus to infect carnivores is determined by its ability to bind to the cell surface receptor. These studies demonstrate that the evolution of a virus, including how long it has been circulating and in which hosts, as well as its phylogenetic background, can have a profound effect on determining its host range."

However, the rapid expansion of mosquito populations has created an urgent need for novel strategies to reduce the transmission of mosquito borne pathogens. Wolbachia, an intracellular bacterium, has recently been shown to inhibit replication of DENV, CHIKV, malaria parasites and filarial nematodes, providing a potentially powerful biocontrol strategy for human pathogens.

In this study we show that a novel mechanism for the regulation of gene expression is introduced by a ligand-sensitive repressor protein called NatR. NatR binds to the promoter of an adhesin gene called NadA and induces the differential expression of the gene at different times. This is a rare example of a bacterial transcriptional repressor binding to a promoter controlled by a ligand, and is the first to be discovered in this way. We also show that the 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, a metabolite of aromatic amino acid catabolism, induces the transcription of a repressor protein called NatR. NatR binds to operator flanking the promoter of an adhesin gene and represses the DNA binding activity of NatR. When induced, only minor differences are evident between natR-independent and repressor-independent transcription levels of promoter phase variants. Our results suggest that NatR-mediated repression is induced by the 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, which is secreted in saliva. The repressor protein is then recruited to the promoter at a specific distance from the operator, allowing interaction of NatR at operators that are distally or overlapping the promoter."

To examine why these systematic asymmetries in vascular branching might arise, we construct a mathematical framework to derive predictions based on local, junction-level optimality principles that have been proposed to be favored in the course of natural selection and development. Our results indicate that material-cost optimizations ( construction materials or blood volume ) and optimization of efficient flow via minimization of metabolic power may be the most important predictor of vascular branching in the human head and torso. In contrast, random branching is comparable to material-cost optimizations for the mouse lung.

The miRNA pathway is defined by the small RNAs that are recognized by Argonautes to direct the degradation of the complementary miRNA transcripts. In plants, the Argonautes ZWICH and ARGONAUTE1 ( AGO1 ) have redundant functions in the miRNA pathway and they are also essential for small RNA-mediated repression. Although these proteins are known to function in diverse cellular processes, little is known about the role of these proteins in the miRNA pathway. Using the model plant Arabidopsis, we demonstrate that the two proteins function redundantly and specifically to regulate a subset of target genes. ZLL, which is involved in small RNA-mediated repression, is required for the expression of most AGO1 targets, while AGO1 is only required for a small subset of them. We also demonstrate that the ZLL protein is involved in 5\u2032-end small RNA selectivity and mRNA cleavage, suggesting that the redundant functions of AGO1 and ZLL are mainly determined by their protein sequence. These results demonstrate that the two proteins have specific functions in the miRNA pathway."

The bacteria that cause leptospirosis are transmitted from animals to humans by carrier animals or direct contact with carrier soil. Little is known about the host factors involved in recognition of these pathogens. We show that bacteria that cause leptospirosis evade recognition by two human innate immune receptors, NOD1 and NOD2. NOD1 and NOD2 recognize different types of bacteria by binding to specific cell-surface receptors. We found that the outer membrane lipoprotein LipL21, which is specific to pathogenic leptospires, binds to NOD1 and NOD2 receptors, preventing their recognition. LipL21 also affects the cleavage of the bacterial outer membrane lipoprotein, and we show that this process is mediated by the human NOD1 receptor, hNOD1. These results suggest that LipL21 may be a host factor that allows bacteria to escape recognition by NOD1 and NOD2 receptors."

In addition to regulating ATP levels, it can also modulate the function of many proteins by transducing their binding energy into protein conformational changes. A method has been developed to analyze the structural changes induced by ATP binding to a protein by computing its free energy landscape ( FEL ). The method is applied to characterize the mechanism by which the binding of ATP to the nucleotide-binding domain ( NBD ) of Hsp70 propagates a signal to its substrate-binding domain ( SBD ). Unbiased MD simulations were performed for Hsp70-DnaK chaperone in nucleotide-free, ADP-bound and ATP-bound states. The simulation revealed that the SBD does not interact with the NBD for DnaK in its nucleotide-free and ADP-bound states. The docking of the SBD was found in the ATP-bound state. The analysis of the FEL projected along the amino-acid sequence permitted to identify a subset of 27 protein internal coordinates corresponding to a network of 91 key residues involved in the conformational change induced by ATP binding. Among the 26 identified residues, 26 are identified for the first time. The analysis also revealed the origin of the ATP-induced structural modifications of the SBD recently measured by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. The pathway between the nucleotide-free and intermediate state of DnaK was extracted by applying principal component analysis to the subset of internal coordinates describing the transition. The methodology proposed is general and could be applied to analyze allosteric communication in other proteins."

We identified 203 genes that were differentially up-regulated ( DUR ) or down-regulated ( DDR ) during infection with one of the three flaviviruses. Comparative analysis revealed that the expression profile of 20 DUR genes and 15 DDR genes was quite similar between the three flaviviruses on D1 of infection, indicating a potentially conserved transcriptomic signature of flaviviral infection. Bioinformatics analysis revealed changes in expression of genes from diverse cellular processes, including ion binding, transport, metabolic processes and peptidase activity.

This result indicates that the transcription unit is highly modular and that the HP1-binding sites are marked by the histone H3. 3 and dimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me2 ). Interestingly, H3. 3 deposition is usually observed only on the 5\u2032 ends of HP1-bound genes. Thus, H3. 3 and HP1 are mutually exclusive marks on active chromatin. Additionally, we observed that the Polycomb-chromatin and the HP1-coding chromatin are nonoverlapping, but often closely juxtaposed, suggesting that both types of chromatin are linked by interlinks. These results demonstrate that HP1-coding chromatin is transcriptionally active and has extensive links with several other chromatin components."

Telomere capping proteins, such as Cdc13 and POT1, are essential for the viability of budding yeast and mammalian cells, respectively. To identify functions required for survival of budding yeast cells lacking Cdc13, we performed a genetic screen. We found that simultaneous inactivation of three DNA damage response ( DDR ) proteins, Sgs1, Exo1, and Rad9, is sufficient to allow cell survival in the absence of Cdc13. Quantitative amplification of ssDNA ( QAOS ) was used to show that the RecQ helicase Sgs1 plays an important role in the resection of uncapped telomeres, especially in the absence of checkpoint protein Rad9. Strikingly, with continued passage, the telomeres of such strains eventually become short and are maintained by recombination-based mechanisms. Remarkably, cdc13\u0394 rad9\u0394 sgs1\u0394 exo1\u0394 strains, lacking any Cdc13 gene product, are viable and can grow indefinitely.

We first treated the liver fluke with praziquantel and then infected the mice with the parasite eggs. Then, we treated the mice with praziquantel at the time when the liver fluke egg-laying begins and treated the mice with praziquantel at the time when egg-laying begins. After treating the mice with praziquantel, we examined the liver fluke response using next-generation sequencing technology. We found that the liver fluke response to praziquantel was gene-specific and that the juvenile fluke response was able to respond to praziquantel, but the adult fluke response was unable to respond to the drug. We then examined the liver fluke response to praziquantel and the induction of gene expression for 10 different fluke genes. We found that the liver fluke response to praziquantel induced gene expression for 16 juvenile fluke genes. We also found that the parasite ATP-binding cassette transporter gene family was responsive to praziquantel and that it was able to significantly induce the activities of 2 of the 16 fluke genes.

Here, by investigating the interacting partners and function of the cellular protein NS1-binding protein ( NS1-BP ), we revealed novel players in the splicing of the M1 segment. We identified that low levels of NS1-BP specifically impaired proper alternative splicing of the viral M1 mRNA segment to yield the M2 mRNA without affecting splicing of mRNA3, mRNA4, or NS mRNA segments. Further biochemical analysis by formaldehyde and UV cross-linking demonstrated that NS1-BP did not interact directly with viral M1 mRNA but its interacting partners, hnRNPs A1, K, L, and M, directly bound M1 mRNA.

None of the children ( aged 10\u201314 years ) examined in the East CDTI project harboured high ( 8, 000\u201330, 000 mf/ml ) or very high ( >30, 000 mf/ml ) microfilariae in the blood. Individuals who took >5 ivermectin treatments were 2. 1 times more likely to present with no microfilaraemia than those with less treatments. In areas where onchocerciasis and loiasis are co-endemic, CDTI reduces the number of, and microfilaraemia in L. loa-infected individuals, and this, in turn, will help to prevent non-neurologic and neurological complications post-ivermectin treatment among CDTI adherents."

The heterochromatin mark methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 ( H3K9me ) is a chromatin mark that is associated with gene silencing and chromosome structure. The H3K9me mark is removed by the histone demethylases H3K4 and H3K8. Heterochromatin proteins, important regulators of gene silencing and chromosome structure, are also associated with the H3K9me mark. In Drosophila melanogaster, three histone demethylases are associated with the methylation of H3K9:Su ( var ) 3-9, Setdb1, and G9a. To probe the dependence of heterochromatin protein 1a ( HP1a ) on H3K9me, its dependence on these three histone demethylases, and the division of labor between the three HKMTs, we have examined correlations between HP1a binding and H3K9me patterns in wild type and null mutants of these three HKMTs. We show here that SU ( var ) 3-9 controls H3K9me-dependent binding of HP1a in pericentromeric regions, while Setdb1 controls it in cytological region 2L:31 and ( together with POF ) in chromosome 4. HP1a binds to the promoters and within bodies of active genes in these three regions. Rather, it is associated with heterochromatin protein 2 ( HP2 ) and open chromatin. Our results support a hypothesis in which HP1a nucleates with high affinity independently of H3K9me in promoters of active genes and then spreads via H3K9 methylation and transient looping contacts with those H3K9me target sites."

This apparent paradox has been highlighted by a recent study showing that on a per capita basis, visits to natural areas in the United States and Japan have declined over the last two decades. These results have been cited as evidence of \u201ca fundamental and pervasive shift away from nature-based recreation\u201d\u2014but how widespread is this phenomenon? We addressed this question by looking at temporal trends in numbers of visitors at 280 protected areas ( PAs ) from 20 countries. This more geographically representative dataset shows that while PAs visitation is indeed declining in the United States and Japan, it is generally increasing elsewhere. We found that total visit numbers are growing in 15 of the 20 countries for which we could get data, with the median national rate of change unrelated to the national rate of population growth but negatively associated with wealth. Despite this trend reversal, it is clear that despite important downturns in some countries, nature-related tourism is far from declining everywhere, and may still have considerable potential both to generate funds for conservation and to shape people's attitudes to the environment."

E6 accomplishes this by interacting with and activating cellular proteins that influence the activity of several cellular pathways, which in turn result in changes in the cancer cell. We show here that E6 also has a key role in the context of a second type of cancer, the high risk HPV-induced cancers. We demonstrate that E6 and cellular proteins that are part of the viral life cycle, in addition to activating the cellular protein SGEF, are responsible for increasing the invasive capacity of both HPV types of cells.

This pathway is activated via a Syk-CARD9-NF-\u03baB signaling axis and requires the NLRP3 inflammasome.

While some have suggested that these three traits are different views of similar concepts, it is not yet clear whether they have the same underlying genetic mechanism. Here, we identify a QTL affecting the ( co ) variance of the ( n ) phenotypes of the model flowering plant Boechera stricta, a closely related relative of Arabidopsis. The magnitude and direction of the effects depend on the environment, and to our knowledge, this reversibility of canalization effects across environments has not been reported previously. We demonstrate that the magnitude and direction of nFT effects depend on the environment, and on the genetic background, which we show to have a major influence on trait variation. We also show that the genetic background can affect the effects of nFT on the trait covariance structure, as well as on the effects of the candidate gene FT on the trait.

Here, we provide a rare quantification of the demographical impacts associated with the failure of a species to modify its phenology in response to a changing world. Our study provides a rare quantitative understanding of the demographic costs associated with the failure of a species to modify its phenology in response to a changing world. Given these fitness costs, the lack of response of roe deer birth dates to match the increasingly earlier onset of spring is in stark contrast with the marked phenotypic responses to climate change reported in many other mammals. We suggest that the lack of phenotypic plasticity in birth timing is linked to its inability to track environmental cues of variation in resource availability for the timing of parturition."

We show that the duration of protection is a function of the initial immune response and that it decays over time.

Period 1, on the other hand, is defined as the time when the cell cycle is completely synchronized with the circadian clock.

Exome sequencing of superior coloboma patients identified rare variants in a Bone Morphogenetic Protein ( Bmp ) receptor ( BMPR1A ) and T-box transcription factor ( TBX2 ). Consistent with this, we find sulcus closure defects in zebrafish lacking Bmp signaling or Tbx2b. In addition, loss of dorsal ocular Bmp is rescued by concomitant suppression of the ventral-specific Hedgehog pathway, arguing that sulcus closure is dependent on dorsal-ventral eye patterning cues. Our findings explain the existence of superior coloboma, a congenital ocular anomaly resulting from aberrant morphogenesis of a developmental structure."

It is also involved in gene silencing and is involved in plant development. Although it is well documented, the mechanism of RdDM is not well understood. We show here that RdDM can repress the activity of distant genes, but it is unable to do so in the absence of transcriptional silencing. This suggests that RdDM acts via chromosomal interactions between distant genes. Our results also suggest that RdDM may be recruited to genomic sequences that are distant from genes, and that this process prevents the formation of chromosomal interactions between genes and their distant regulatory elements."

The disease is heterogeneous, and its subtypes are classified as type 1 ( HME I ) and type 2 ( HME II ) based on their pathological features. HME patients are also affected by changes in the cranial base of the growth plates, which is the site of future cartilage biopsies. The present study is the first to analyze the cranial base of the growth plates in HME patients and to investigate the effect of osteochondroma growth on the growth of cartilage cells. Interestingly, osteochondroma was found in patients with HME in the cranial base and we identified the mechanisms that could lead to osteochondroma formation.

Here we investigate the development between 13 and 95 days in vitro ( DIV ) of cultured cortical cell cultures ( n\u200a=\u200a20 ). We find four different phases, related to their morphological maturation: An initial low-activity state ( \u224819 DIV ) is followed by a supercritical ( \u224820 DIV ) and then a subcritical one ( \u224836 DIV ) until the network finally reaches stable criticality ( \u224858 DIV ). Based on physiological observations, the connectivity of the model neurons to the developing network is determined by the drive of the neurons to adjust their connectivity for reaching on average firing rate homeostasis. We predict a specific time course for the development of inhibition, with strong onset and delayed pruning, and that total synaptic connectivity should be strongly linked to the relative levels of excitation and inhibition. Our results suggest that the interplay between activity and connectivity guides developing networks into criticality suggesting that this may be a generic and stable state of many neural networks in vivo and in vitro."

Recently, we have reported that RECA1, a nucleotide helicase, controls mitochondrial genome stability by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats in the moss P. patens plastid and mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ). In this study, we investigated the effects of the RECA1 knockout ( KO ) mutation on the stability of mitochondrial genome and the plastid genome. The RECG ( Escherichia coli RECA1 homolog ) knockout ( KO ) mutation caused characteristic phenotypes including growth delay and developmental and mitochondrial defects. Analyses of RECG KO plants showed that mitochondrial genome was destabilized due to a recombination between 8\u201379 bp repeats and the pattern of the recombination partly differed from that observed in the RECA1 KO mutants. We found that the mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) instability was greater in severe phenotypic RECG KO cells than that in mild phenotypic ones. This result suggests that mitochondrial genomic instability is responsible for the defective phenotypes of RECG KO plants. We also found that the RECG KO mutation induced remarkable plastid abnormalities and induced recombination between short repeats in the plastid DNA. Our results suggest that RECG plays a role in the maintenance of both plastid and mitochondrial genome stability by suppressing aberrant recombination between dispersed short repeats."

Here, we used a rodent model of RA and periodontal infection to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-inflammatory response. We found that P. gingivalis, a common bacterium in the mouth, was able to enhance the severity of RA and to progress to the most common type of RA. The ability of P. gingivalis to increase the severity of RA was dependent on the expression of a unique bacterial enzyme called peptidylarginine deiminase ( PAD ), which converts arginine residues in proteins to citrulline. Infection with P. gingivalis was responsible for significantly increased levels of autoantibodies to collagen type II and citrullinated epitopes as a P. gingivalis mutant did not elicit similar host response. We also showed that citrullinated proteins were also detected at the site of infection with P. gingivalis. Our results suggest bacterial PAD as the mechanistic link between P. gingivalis periodontal infection and rheumatoid arthritis."

We observed a conserved proline in the linker of all nine proteins. In all cases, the prolines pucker substantially and the pucker is associated with the backbone rotation toward the E2/ubiquitin.

Previous risk assessment on FZT transmission in the Red River Delta of Vietnam identified carp nurseries as major transmission sites. In this study, we analyzed the association between snail population density and heterophyid trematode infection in snails with the rate of FZT transmission to juvenile fish. We also investigated the association between the intensity of fish FZT infections and the total number and density of potential host snails and the prevalence of host snails infected with heterophyid trematodes.

We also found that some of the snails in the pond with no or few infected snails were collected also had high prevalence and intensity of FZT in juvenile fish.

We find that heterogeneous contact patterns cause earlier and larger epidemics in the SIR model in comparison to homogeneous scenarios for a vast range of parameter values, while smaller epidemics may happen in some combinations of parameters. In the case of SI and heterogeneous patterns, epidemics develop faster in the earlier stages followed by a slowdown in the asymptotic limit.

A limitation of this approach is the inability to detect a protein when its concentration falls below the limit of detection. Consequently, differential expression of proteins may be missed when the level of a protein in the cases or controls is below the limit of detection for 2DPAGE. Standard statistical techniques have difficulty dealing with undetected proteins. To address this issue, we propose a statistical model that takes into account both detected and non-detected proteins. Non-detected proteins are classified either as ( a ) proteins that are not expressed in at least one replicate, or ( b ) proteins that are expressed but are below the limit of detection. We obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the mixture model, including the group-specific probability of expression and mean expression intensities. Differently expressed proteins can be detected by using a Likelihood Ratio Test ( LRT ). Our simulation results, using data generated from biological experiments, show that the likelihood model has higher statistical power than standard statistical approaches to detect differentially expressed proteins. An R package, Slc ( Statistical-Like Analysis for Identifying Differential Expression in R ), is freely available at http://www. cebl. auckland. ac. nz/session/software/ is used to demonstrate how the likelihood model can be used to identify differentially expressed proteins."

In insects, Hox genes regulate the expression of other genes in a spatially restricted manner, including the sex determination gene sex combs reduced. In Drosophila, the expression of sex combs reduced is determined by the spatially localized expression of Scr, a transcription factor that is activated in a restricted spatial domain of the first thoracic ( T1 ) leg. Scr is required for the development of T1-specific bristle cells in both sexes and sex combs. However, it is unclear how Scr is integrated into the gene regulatory network required for T1-specific organ development. Here, we identified two cis-regulatory elements that control spatially localized Scr expression. One of these enhancers directs sexually dimorphic expression and is required for the development of T1-specific bristle patterns. We show that the Distalless and Engrailed homeodomain transcription factors act through sequences in this enhancer to establish elevated Scr expression in spatially defined domains.

Mice infected with RV1B were superinfected with NTHi and lung bacterial density, chemokines and neutrophil counts determined. Mice were also infected with RV, TLR2 agonists or TLR5 agonists. Chemokine levels were measured by ELISA and expression of IRAK-1, a component of MyD88-dependent TLR signaling. While sham-infected mice cleared NTHi from the lungs, RV-infected mice showed bacteria up to 72 h post-infection. Delayed bacterial clearance in RV/NTHi-infected mice was associated with suppressed chemokine production and neutrophil recruitment. RV-infected BEAS-2B and MH-S cells showed attenuated chemokine production after challenge with either NTHi or TLR agonists. Attenuated chemokine responses were associated with IRAK-1 protein degradation. Inhibition of RV-induced IRAK-1 degradation restored NTHi-stimulated IL-8 expression. Knockdown of TLR2, but not other MyD88-dependent TLRs, also restored IRAK-1, suggesting that TLR2 is required for RV-induced IRAK-1 degradation.

Epstein-Barr virus is a gammaherpesvirus and expresses its structural proteins as part of the viral particle. While the protein BZLF1 ( Z ) is expressed on the viral particles and functions to activate the expression of the viral proteins BRRF1 and BRRF2, it is the only known virus promoter that is methylated. We now demonstrate that Z is also able to activate the methylated form of BRRF1, and that this activity requires two methylation sites on the Z protein. These methylation sites are critical for the activity of Z. We also show that the two sites on Z are required for the induction of the expression of the viral protein Ngn1. Our results indicate that methylation on Z is important for the reactivation of EBV from latency, and suggest that methylation may also be important for the establishment of latency following infection."

The JAK/STAT pathway is controlled by the Wing and Wasp signaling molecules. However, it remains poorly understood how JAK/STAT signaling activity is regulated in these processes. In this study, we have identified the wdp gene as a novel component of the JAK/STAT pathway. We demonstrate that wdp is positively regulated by JAK/STAT signaling in Drosophila intestinal epithelia. wdp loss causes the disruption of midgut homeostasis under normal and regenerative conditions. Conversely, ectopic expression of wdp inhibits JAK/STAT signaling activity. Importantly, we show that Wdp interacts with the receptor Domeless ( Dome ), and promotes its internalization for subsequent lysosomal degradation. Together, these data led us to propose that Wdp acts as a novel negative feedback regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway in regulating intestinal homeostasis."

The biophysical properties of biological membranes are characterized by a variety of mechanical parameters, such as stiffness and conductance. These parameters have been quantified to a level that allows for detailed comparison across different species. We have examined the effects of mechanical properties on protein structure and dynamics. We show that a particular mechanical parameter, elastic forces, have a strong effect on the stability of the protein. Specifically, elastic forces cause cooperative gating, i. e., the simultaneous activity of two or more proteins is altered such that one protein binds to both of the other proteins. We also show that the spatial organization of proteins into functional units, such as complexes or nanostructures, is also dependent on mechanical properties. Specifically, we find that the spatial organization of the protein can have a profound effect on the stability of the protein, as well as on the dynamics of the protein, in a particular case. These results provide important insight into the roles of mechanical properties on protein structure and dynamics, and into the organization of biological membranes."

During the epidemic, incidence data were collected and published at increasing resolution. We develop a novel spatiotemporal analysis method that combines a local model for time-varying effective reproduction numbers with a gravity-type model for spatial dispersion of the infection. We test this method in simulations and apply it to the weekly incidences of confirmed and probable cases. Our results indicate that, of the newly infected cases, only a small percentage, between 4% and 10%, migrates to another district, and a minority of these migrants, between 0% and 23%, leave their country. The epidemics in the three countries are found to be similar in estimated effective reproduction numbers, and in the probability of importing infection into a district. The countries might have played different roles in cross-border transmissions, although a sensitivity analysis suggests that this could also be related to underreporting. The spatiotemporal analysis method can exploit available longitudinal incidence data at different geographical locations to monitor local epidemics, determine the extent of spatial spread, reveal the contribution of local and imported cases, and identify sources of introductions in uninfected areas. With good quality data on incidence, this analysis method can help to effectively control emerging infections."

The viral genome is packaged into particles by a process termed viral particle assembly. We have recently shown that one of the viral proteins, virion host shutoff ( vhs ), is also active against viral mRNAs, thereby preventing their uncontrolled degradation. In this study, we have performed a dual transcriptomic analysis and single-cell mRNA FISH to study the mechanism of action of vhs. We have found that vhs is involved in the regulation of the host cell transcriptome in two ways. First, vhs is involved in maintaining the nuclear retention of viral mRNAs. Second, vhs appears to regulate the transcription of viral mRNAs. Our data suggest that the late expression of viral mRNAs is regulated by vhs and that the cellular mRNA cycle and the nuclear retention of these mRNAs are coordinated to allow efficient and robust expression of viral proteins."

We found that, although the inactivation of each C. elegans gene is associated with a mild OXPHOS dysfunction, mutations in mtcu-1 or mtcu-2 cause changes in the expression of metabolic and mitochondrial stress response genes that are quite different from those caused by mttu-1 mutations. Our data suggest that retrograde signaling promotes defect-specific metabolic reprogramming, which is able to rescue the OXPHOS dysfunction in the single mutants by stimulating the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle flux through complex II. However, this adaptive response appears to be associated with a biological cost since the single mutants exhibit decreased fertility and long reproductive cycle. We further show that mttu-1; mttu-1 and mtcu-2; mttu-1 double mutants display severe growth defects and sterility.

Simulations were performed to explore the effects of noise on developmental reproducibility, in particular the effects of noise intensity.

Here, we show that DnaA is bound to oriC with a half-time of 2. 5 seconds. DnaA shows similar turnover at the replication machinery, showing a half-time of 2. 5 seconds. The absence of YabA increases the half time binding of DnaA to oriC, showing that YabA plays a dual role in the regulation of DnaA, as a tether at the replication forks, and as a chaser at origin regions. Likewise, a deletion of soj ( encoding a ParA protein ) leads to an increase in residence time and to overinitiation, while a mutation in DnaA that leads to lowered initiation frequency, due to a reduced ATPase activity, shows a decreased residence time on binding sites. Finally, our single molecule tracking experiments show that DnaA rapidly moves between chromosomal binding sites, and does not arrest for more than few hundreds of milliseconds. In Escherichia coli, DnaA shows low residence times in the range of 200 ms and oscillates between spatially opposite chromosome regions in a time frame of one to two seconds, independently of ongoing transcription. Thus, DnaA shows extremely rapid binding turnover on the chromosome including oriC regions in two bacterial species, which is influenced by Soj and YabA proteins in B. subtilis, and is crucial for balanced initiation control, likely preventing fatal premature multimerization and strand opening of DnaA at oriC."

The median cost of TIS and TSS was $8, 298 per evaluation unit [interquartile range ( IQR ) : $6, 532\u2013$10, 111, 2017 USD]. Based on a linear regression with bootstrapped confidence intervals, after controlling for country, costs per survey did not change significantly over time but did decline by $83 per survey implemented in a single round ( 95% CI: -$108\u2013-$63 ). Of total costs, 80% went to survey field work; of that, 58% went towards per diems and 38% went towards travel. Within a given country, within a given district, they cost a median of $9, 707 ( IQR: $8, 537\u2013$11, 635 ) ; within a district, within a given health district, or across the district, they cost a median of $10, 000\u2013$25, 000 ( IQR: $8, 000\u2013$25, 000 ). These results provide the first estimates of the costs of TIS, TSS, and TT-only surveys in 322 evaluation units. We also provide guidance on how these expenditures are distributed and how they compare to other types of expenditures."

It is caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasites, which are transmitted by mosquitoes. Every year, more than 1. 5 billion people are at risk of being infected. Malaria, which is the most important infectious cause of mortality worldwide, is caused by parasites that invade and multiply in the liver. Malaria parasites are taken up by mosquitoes when they bite humans and they invade the brain. The liver becomes the site of pathology, including the brain and the spleen. In the murine model of cerebral malaria, we previously demonstrated that parasite-infected mice, which are susceptible to being infected with the parasite, cross-present parasite antigens to CD8+ T lymphocytes, a component of the immune response. CD8+ T cells are specialized effector cells that kill parasites and can kill infected cells. Here, we show that brain endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels in the brain, are responsible for cross-presenting parasite antigens to CD8+ T cells. We also show that parasites do not induce the antigen in these cells. Finally, we show that malaria parasites that do not invade the brain can be taken up by these cells. Our work suggests that interfering with merozoite phagocytosis or antigen processing may be effective strategies for cerebral malaria intervention."

However, these open-source alternatives cannot analyze sperm kinetic responses to different stimuli, such as chemotaxis, thermotaxis or rheotaxis. In addition, the programs released to date have not usually been designed to encourage the scalability and the continuity of software development.

This platform will allow researchers not only to download the software but also to be involved in and contribute to further developments. Additionally, a Google group has been created to allow the research community to interact and discuss OpenCASA.

Pathogen phylogenies, which describe the evolutionary history of a pathogen within a host, also show how the host contact network influences pathogen evolution. In this paper, we develop a novel method for relating network structure to pathogen evolution, by comparing the epidemic spread and evolution of pathogen phylogenies on different host networks. We find that networks with more heterogeneous network structure also show greater diversity of cluster numbers, shorter mean branch lengths, and somewhat higher tree imbalance than networks with relatively homogeneous structure. However, we find that these effects are relatively modest, and that the role of the epidemic trajectory, the dynamics of the network, and the inherent variability of metrics such as cluster size must each be taken into account when trying to understand characteristics about the underlying host contact network."

In this study, we investigate the dynamical mechanism of auto-inhibition by using a novel normal mode analysis of an elastic network model drawn from microsecond molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the auto-inhibitory domain ( AID ) inhibits AMPK activity by restraining the kinase domain ( KD ) into an unproductive open conformation, thereby limiting local structural rearrangements, while mutations that disrupt the interactions between the KD and AID prevent both local structural rearrangements and global interlobe conformational transition. Our results further suggest that AID also impacts the structuring and mobility of the activation loop."

We have used a previously developed predictive algorithm to analyze the propensity of the 34, 180 human protein sequences to form amyloid-like fibrils. We show that long proteins have, on average, less intense aggregation peaks than short ones. Human proteins involved in protein deposition diseases do not differ extensively from the rest of the proteome, further demonstrating the generality of protein aggregation. We were also able to reproduce some of the results obtained with other algorithms, demonstrating that they do not depend on the type of computational tool employed. Our results emphasize the existence of intimate links between the propensity of proteins to form aggregates with \u03b2-structure and their biology. In particular, they emphasize the existence of a negative selection pressure that finely modulates protein sequences in order to adapt their aggregation propensity to their biological context."

In eukaryotes, there are hundreds of such proteins called transcription factors that control gene expression by binding to DNA. In this study, we describe a novel mechanism whereby a transcription factor called KRAB can control transcription by spreading heterochromatin, which is a repressive chromatin structure. By targeting a gene involved in human development to a drug-controllable repressor, we show that KRAB and its corepressor KAP1 can silence the transcription of hundreds of genes. We also provide evidence that this long-range repression is initiated by the long-range spreading of a histone modification, H3K9 trimethylation, and heterochromatin protein 1 \u03b2 ( HP1\u03b2 ). Together, our data support a model in which KRAB and its corepressor KAP1 recruit heterochromatin and long-range spreading to control transcription in the repression of hundreds of genes.

It is thought that the stability of the latent reservoir is due to low-level viral replication that continuously replenishes the reservoir despite HAART. Here, we offer the first quantitative study to our knowledge of inflow of newly infected cells into the latent reservoir due to viral replication in the setting of HAART. We make use of a previous observation that in some patients on HAART, the residual viremia is dominated by a predominant plasma clone of HIV-1 not found in the latent reservoir. Our results show that the magnitude of the maximum daily inflow rate is small compared to the size of the latent reservoir, and therefore any inflow that occurs in patients on HAART is unlikely to significantly influence the decay rate of the latent reservoir. Thus, intensification of standard HAART regimens should have minimal effects on the decay of the latent reservoir."

Here, we use the fruit fly model to identify genes that are critical to normal physiological function. We find that manipulating the expression of a single gene, Spen, has a profound effect on larval fat levels. Deletion of Spen in mice results in major changes in the levels of metabolic enzymes and metabolites involved in \u03b2-oxidation. Spen also counteracts Spen\u2019s role in fat regulation. Spen and Spenito transcript levels are conserved in human cells, and our results suggest that this is a conserved function of Spen.

SIRT1 binds to the viral genomes and regulates the acetylation of two histone proteins ( Lys26 and H4 ) bound to the viral genomes. The differentiation-dependent replication of high-risk HPVs requires activation of factors in the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated ( ATM ) pathway and SIRT1 regulates the recruitment of both NBS1 and Rad51 to the viral genomes.

Here, we demonstrate that hypermutation induced by APOBEC3 proteins does not significantly affect the rate of recombination, and it does not significantly affect the frequency of viral mutations in the viral genomes. We also show that hypermutation induced by APOBEC3 proteins does not significantly contribute to HIV-1 genetic variation in vivo since it is very rare for the viral genomes to copackage with hypermutated sequences in vivo.

T6SSs are also deployed by human cells against bacteria. However, T6SSs fire at different rates and can use different regulatory pathways. Here, we show that a T6SS of Serratia marcescens, which is used by competitors against bacteria, is regulated by the cellular protein phosphatase PpkA. PpkA activates the kinase which phosphorylates another T6SS component, PpkA. This activation triggers a switch in regulatory strategy which allows the T6SS to fire at all-comers, but only if the T6SS is triggered to fire at an incoming attack. Our study provides new insights into how T6SSs are regulated and deployed. We show that the T6SS of S. marcescens is deployed by a novel regulatory pathway, which is conserved between T6SSs that fire against bacteria and T6SSs that fire against host cells.

We also determined the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex bound with methyl donor SAM.

It is characterized by painless, ulcerative lesions of large size and extensive tissue destruction. The exact transmission mechanism remains unknown. Several arguments indicate a possible role for insects in its transmission. In the present case-control study, we investigated whether adequate wound care and use of bed nets ( appropriate protection against Buruli ulcer ), were associated with the risk of Buruli ulcer. We found that the use of bed net was associated with a 32% reduction in the risk of Buruli ulcer, and with a 34% reduction in the proportion of cases able to be prevented by adequate wound care. The study confirms that adequate wound care and use of bed nets are essential to prevent Buruli ulcer, and should be investigated further. Involvement of insects in the household environment, and the relationship between wound hygiene and M. ulcerans infection should now be investigated."

Here we describe a maize mutation that decreases the plant hormone HC-toxin, which is responsible for the disease resistance conferred by the hypomorphic allele of Hm1A, at the HM1 locus. The genetic defect in the hypomorphic allele is that the gene encodes an NADPH-dependent reductase, which inactivates HC-toxin, the key virulence effector of the plant pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum race 1 ( CCR1 ). The hypomorphic allele encodes a partial loss-of-function mutation, Hm1A, at the HM1 locus. This mutation reduced HC-toxin reductase activity, leading to less accumulation of HC-toxin and reduced resistance in the adult plant. We also show that the hypomorphic allele has undergone relatively conservative missense changes that partially reduce its enzymatic activity. No difference in accumulation of the gene product was observed between adult and juvenile plants, suggesting that the susceptibility of seedlings derives from a greater need for HCTR activity, not reduced accumulation of the gene product. We demonstrate that the energy status of the host has a dramatic effect on resistance afforded by the hypomorphic alleles, demonstrating a link between the energetic or metabolic status of the host and disease resistance."

Aquatic animal organisms are likely to play a role as host reservoirs or vectors of the bacilli. However, information on MU ecological dynamics, both in space and time, is still limited. As a result, the ecology of the disease agent, and consequently its mode of transmission, remains largely unknown. We studied the spatio-temporal dynamics of MU ecological distribution and colonization of aquatic organisms through long-term sampling of 32 communities of aquatic macro-invertebrates and vertebrates from different environments in Cameroon. Our study showed a broad distribution of MU in all ecosystems and taxonomic groups, with important regional variations in its occurrence. Colonization dynamics fluctuated along the year, with the highest peaks in August and October. The large variations observed in the colonization dynamics of different taxonomic groups and aquatic ecosystems suggest that the trends shown here are the result of complex ecological processes that need further investigation."

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the size of the nucleolus varies widely across different cell types. The size of the nucleolus is often coordinated with cell growth and development, however how this relationship is controlled in a cell type specific manner is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a genetic cascade controls the size of the nucleolus and the abundance of a major nucleolar pre-rRNA processing protein FIB-1/fibrillarin. This genetic cascade is regulated by a molecular circuitry that targets the 3\u2019UTR of ncl-1, a major nucleolar pre-rRNA processing protein, and the translation repressor NCL-1. Consequently, the abundance of FIB-1 is tightly controlled and correlated with the nucleolar size. Our findings reveal a novel genetic cascade by which post-transcriptional regulators interplay in developmental control of nucleolar size and function."

This raises the question\u2014how does the mitochondrial arrangement affect the metabolite distributions within cardiomyocytes and what is its impact on force dynamics? Here, we employ computational meshes to explore the role of mitochondrial organisation on cardiac bioenergetics. Our results indicate that heterogeneous mitochondrial distributions can lead to significant spatial variation across the cell in concentrations of inorganic phosphate, creatine ( Cr ) and creatine phosphate ( PCr ). However, our model predicts that sufficient activity of the creatine kinase ( CK ) system, coupled with rapid diffusion of Cr and PCr, maintains near uniform ATP and ADP ratios across the cell cross sections. This homologous distribution of ATP and ADP should also evenly distribute force production and twitch duration with contraction. These results suggest that the PCr shuttle and associated enzymatic reactions act to maintain uniform force dynamics in the cell despite the heterogeneous mitochondrial organisation. However, our model also predicts that under hypoxia activity of mitochondrial CK enzymes and diffusion of high-energy phosphate compounds may be insufficient to sustain uniform ATP/ADP distribution and hence force generation."

This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision-making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the epidemic.

The genetic defect in these mutant muscles is not due to a single defective gene, but rather to mutations in a panel of adhesion molecules, such as integrins. Using a panel of adhesion proteins, we show that elevated expression of the integrin-associated protein PINCH is a key factor in the rescue of muscle hyperactive injury.

Unfortunately, vector control programs are often unsuccessful, and the reasons for this vary depending on the area of application. For example, while malaria control programs are effective in some areas, they are less successful elsewhere. This study examined the impact of vector control on mosquito populations, using data collected from 13\u201315 microsatellite markers for mosquitoes from multiple locations in Guinea, West Africa.

The resulting secondary siRNAs are taken up by a set of Argonaute proteins known to act as siRNA acceptors in exogenous RNAi. Our results show that RDE-1 in an endogenous setting is actively screening the transcriptome using many different small RNAs, including miRNAs, as a guide, with implications for the evolution of transcripts with a potential to be recognized by Dicer."

Herpesviruses infect cells through membrane penetration and budding into cellular compartments, which is initiated by a set of viral proteins. These proteins are candidates for the recognition of viral budding sites on cellular membranes and induction of budding and final envelopment. We have found that ORF45, a protein found on the outer membrane of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ), interacts with lipid rafts ( LRs ) of cellular membrane. In addition, we have found that ORF45 associates with the lipid rafts of cellular membrane, and that the ability of ORF45 to target LR is dependent on the mono-ubiquitylation of ORF45 at Lys297. Our results reveal a new function of KSHV tegument protein ORF45 in targeting LR of host cell membrane, promoting viral particles co-localization with trans-Golgi and endosomes, and facilitating the maturation and release of virion particles, suggesting that ORF45 plays a role in bringing KSHV particles to the budding site on cytoplasmic vesicle membrane and triggering the viral budding process for final envelopment and virion maturation."

In the present study, we investigated the levels and mechanisms of insecticide resistance and resistance mechanisms in Aedes aegypti collected from contrasting settings within and around Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Larval dose-response assays indicated susceptibility to the organophosphates. Adult females were also susceptible to organophosphates but resistance to carbamates was suspected in urban and semi-urban localities. Larval dose-response assays indicated that adult females were susceptible to pyrethroids but resistance to carbamates was suspected in urban and semi-urban populations. Environment was also associated with susceptibility: adult females reared from larvae collected in tires from the semi-urban site were significantly less resistant to pyrethroids than those collected from large outdoor drinking water containers. P450 gene analysis detected limited over-expression of single candidates but significantly elevated average expression in the semi-urban site compared to both a susceptible laboratory colony, and females from the other collection sites. Our results reveal pyrethroid resistance and paired kdr mutations in both urban and semi-urban sites at levels that are unprecedented for mainland Africa. However, organophosphate insecticides are still active against both larvae and adults of Ae. aegypti, providing useful insecticidal options for control and resistance management."

To address this issue, we conducted a rigorous analysis of genomic data integration methods for protein-protein interaction recovery across a large number of co-migration datasets.

HENMT1 loss-of-function, and the concomitant loss of piRNAs, resulted in a deregulation of the haploid germ cell gene expression, elevated levels of DNA damage and a catastrophic deregulation of the haploid germ cell gene expression.

Unexpectedly, we found that some new PNEPs are related to the related Plasmodium protein MSP-7.

We also took advantage of newly found soluble PNEPs to show that this type of exported protein requires unfolding to move from the parasitophorous vacuole ( PV ) into the host cell. This indicates that soluble PNEPs, like PEXEL/HT proteins, are exported by translocation across the PV membrane ( PVM ), highlighting protein translocation in the parasite periphery as a general means in protein export of malaria parasites."

The integration of Th1-promoting interferon ( IFN ) -\u03b3 and interleukin ( IL ) -12 signals together with Th2-favoring IL-4 signals drives the development of the hybrid Th1/2 phenotype. Specifically, IFN-\u03b3 signals are essential for T-bet+GATA-3+ cells to develop in vitro and in vivo by breaking the dominance of IL-4 over IL-12 signals. The hybrid Th1/2 phenotype is stably maintained in memory cells in vivo for months. It resists reprogramming into classic Th1 or Th2 cells by Th1- or Th2-promoting stimuli, which rather induces quantitative modulations of the combined Th1 and Th2 programs without abolishing either. Thus, we propose the self-limitation of effector T cells based on the stable cell-intrinsic balance of two opposing differentiation programs as a novel concept of how the immune system can prevent excessive inflammation."

In this study, I generated mice in which the TLR signaling adapter Myd88 was selectively deleted in dendritic cell ( DC ) or in B cell lineages. Deletion of Myd88 in DCs had little effect on immune control of FV, while B cell-specific deletion of Myd88 caused a dramatically increased number of viral infectious centers and a significantly reduced antibody response, indicating that B cell-intrinsic TLR signaling plays a crucial role, while TLR signaling in DCs is less important. I then identified the single-stranded RNA sensing protein TLR7 as being required for antibody-mediated control of FV by analyzing mice deficient in TLR7. B cells in infected TLR7-deficient mice upregulated CD69 and CD86 early in infection, but failed to develop into germinal center B cells. CD4 T cell responses were also attenuated in the absence of TLR7, but CD8 responses were TLR7 independent, suggesting the existence of additional pathways for detecting retroviral particles.

Large spiders spin up to flight speeds and then take a flight simulator to see what physical properties of these spiders\u2019 cocoons can induce their flight speed. We observed that large spiders spin up to flight speeds with a characteristic length of about 3. 22 \u00b1 1. 31 m. The length of these threads was 3. 22 \u00b1 1. 31 m. These physical properties of balloon-shaped spiders can explain the illusion of airflow, i. e., the illusion of wind speed, that spiders spin up when the wind speed is slower than 3 m s\u22121. This regime is strongly correlated with lower wind speeds."

Attention is generally thought to be critical for the processing of sensory information, but the role of attention in higher brain areas is still debated. Here, we investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying attentional remapping in monkeys, a form of attentional shift in which sensory information is shifted from the periphery to the central region. We recorded from two monkeys while they made eye movements in order to control attention to one of two locations. We show that the responses of some neurons in the central region, the temporal lobe, are modified by attention to one of the two eye movements. We also show that top-down attention is required to efficiently modify the responses of other neurons. Our data provide the first demonstration of the influence of top-down attention on the memory trace, anywhere in the brain, and provide important information on the perisaccadic representation of visual stimuli in the dorsal stream."

Although the primary sites of DNA methylation in vertebrates are cytosines in the CpG dinucleotide context, little is known about DNA methylation targeting CpA, CpT, and CpC ( non-CpG ) dinucleotides. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of non-CpG methylation in 76 genome-scale DNA methylation maps across human cell types. We confirm that non-CpG methylation is predominantly present in pluripotent cell types and show that it is highly variable and show little conservation between different pluripotent cell lines. We also show that knockdown of DNMTA and DNMT3 in human ESCs results in a global reduction of non-CpG methylation. Finally, non-CpG methylation appears to be spatially correlated with CpG methylation.

In these cases, the PD-1 pathway is activated and the cell becomes resistant to killing by the immune system. In this study we examined the role of PD-1 signaling in the recognition and killing of virus-infected cells. We found that the expression of PD-1 is increased on retrovirus-infected cells that are being targeted by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. The increased PD-1 expression on virus-infected cells enhances the immune response to the virus, but can also cause an immune escape mechanism.

Absence of the 2C7 epitope shortens the time of gonococcal carriage in a mouse model of genital infection. To circumvent the limitations of saccharide immunogens in producing long lived immune responses, previously we developed a peptide mimic ( called PEP1 ) as an immunologic surrogate of the 2C7-OS epitope and reconfigured it into a multi-antigenic peptide ( MAP1 ). To test vaccine efficacy of MAP1, female BALB/c mice were passively immunized with a complement-dependent bactericidal monoclonal antibody specific for the 2C7 epitope or were actively immunized with MAP1. Mice immunized with MAP1 developed a TH1-biased anti-LOS IgG antibody response that was also bactericidal. Length of carriage was shortened in immune mice; clearance occurred in 4 days in mice passively administered 2C7 antibody vs. 9 days in mice immunized with control peptide.

Growth of V. cholerae on a chitin surface induces competence for natural transformation, a mechanism for intra-species gene exchange. O-serogroup genes are encoded by a genetic cluster that is flanked on either side by chromosomal regions that are conserved between different serogroups. Here we describe a novel mechanism of natural transformation that involves a single-step exchange of large fragments of DNA that occurs as a single-step exchange of large fragments of DNA. The process is mediated by O-antigenic determinant, which is encoded by a large genomic DNA segment that is flanked by a motif conserved between different serogroups, and is transferred to an O1 strain by a virulent O1-specific phage. Serogroup conversion of O1 recipient by the O139 donor was demonstrated by comparative genomic hybridization, biochemical and serological characterization of the O-antigenic determinant, and resistance of O1 transformants to bacteriolysis by a virulent O1-specific phage. Serogroup conversion is shown to have occurred as a single-step exchange of large fragments of DNA. Crossovers were localized to regions of homology common to other V. cholerae serogroups that flank serogroup-specific encoding sequences. This result and the successful serogroup conversion of an O1 strain by O37 genomic DNA indicate that chitin-induced natural transformation might be a common mechanism for serogroup conversion in aquatic habitats and for the emergence of V. cholerae variants that are better adapted for survival in environmental niches or more pathogenic for humans."

This was due, at least in part, to increased production of type I interferon ( IFN ) pathway cytokines, which were induced by infection.

In France, the disease has been reported from the south of France, in the Pyr\u00e9nethylene-Orientales ( C\u00e9vennes ) and in the Mediterranean coast ( Provence ). In the present study, 270 L. infantum strains were analysed from 1978 to 2011 from the four endemic areas of France, the two cities of Nice ( AM ) and Marseille ( P ), the two Mediterranean coast ( MCL ) and the Corsica ( CO ) province. We found a strong genetic differentiation between the Leishmania populations from AM and P. However, exchanges were observed between these two endemic areas in which it seems that strains spread from AM to P. Our results shed light on the transmission dynamics of parasites in humans."

The molecular mechanisms of cell differentiation are often thought to involve gene transcriptional regulation. Differentiation can also be triggered by repressors, proteins that are recruited to the chromosome. How these regulators influence cell differentiation, however, remains largely unclear. In this work, we have investigated the role of chromatin-based epigenetic effects in controlling the expression of a single gene and the expression of a set of genes. Our experiments confirm that recruitment of repressor and activator proteins permits a plastic form of control; the stability of gene expression is determined by the spatial distribution of nucleation sites along the chromosome. The unveiled regulatory principles will help to understand the mechanisms of cell differentiation and to design synthetic genetic networks that combine transcriptional regulatory motifs and chromatin-based epigenetic effects."

In this study, we have evaluated the efficacy of combining a third-generation cephalosporin ( Cen ) and azithromycin ( Aza ) for FCT treatment in patients living in an endemic region. Patients were divided based on the results of blood culture analysis and treated according to a single- or a combined-therapy regimen. The study showed that FCT and the secondary outcome of treatment was significantly shorter for the latter, and this effect was exhibited in both the hospitalized and the outpatient sub-groups. Repeat blood cultures, drawn on day 3, were positive for 17% of the patients after monotherapy, versus 2/51 ( 4% ) after combination therapy ( p = 0\u00b7045 ). No severe complications or fatalities occurred in any of the groups. Combined therapy of third-generation cephalosporins and azithromycin for TF may surpass monotherapy in terms of FCT and time to elimination of bacteremia."

We showed the COOP to be useful for quantifying the consistency of construct orientation within cells of the same shape.

Whole-genome sequencing ( WGS ) has the potential to enable both approaches. However, WGS introduces new complexities that must be addressed in order to achieve relationship detection. In this study, we estimated the relationship between 258 individuals from WGS data and compared it with existing approaches. We found that WGS data could be used to identify genomic regions with substantial SNP heterogeneity that may lead to false-positive relationships among controls. We then developed a new method to identify and mask genomic regions with excess SNP heterogeneity. Our results show that WGS data provides a 5% to 15% increase in relationship detection power relative to high-density microarray data for distant relationships.

We investigate the most likely transmission routes in Africa by comparing two established models of transmission within a Bayesian model averaging framework. Our models assume contrasting scenarios of the yellow fever transmission cycle in Africa. One takes the force of infection in each province to be static across the observation period; this is synonymous with a constant infection pressure from the sylvatic reservoir. The other model assumes the majority of transmission results from the urban cycle; in this case, the force of infection is dynamic and defined through a fixed value of R0 in each province. We compare these contrasting descriptions of transmission through a Bayesian framework and trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling in order to assess each model\u2019s evidence given the range of uncertainty in parameter values. Our results show strong support for the static model which suggests a higher proportion of yellow fever transmission occurs as a result of infection from an external source such as the sylvatic reservoir. However, the model comparison highlights key data gaps in serological surveys across the African endemic region. Our approach provides a robust framework for model comparison and predicting yellow fever burden in Africa."

In the present study, we have demonstrated the disruption of myelin junctions in a mouse model of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies ( HNPP ). We observed that the myelin junctions were disrupted in the absence of demyelination, which was present long before the demyelination was completed.

The regulatory protein HBx has been shown to be essential for cccDNA transcription in the context of infection. Here we identified Spindlin1, a cellular Tudor-domain protein, as an HBx interacting partner. We further demonstrated that Spindlin1 is recruited to the cccDNA and inhibits its transcription in the context of infection. Knockdown of Spindlin1 induced an increase in HBV transcription and in histone H4K4 trimethylation at the cccDNA, suggesting that Spindlin1 impacts on epigenetic regulation. Spindlin1-induced transcriptional inhibition was greater for the HBV virus deficient for the expression of HBx than for the HBV WT virus, suggesting that HBx counteracts Spindlin1 repression. Importantly, we showed that the repressive role of Spindlin1 is not limited to HBV transcription but also extends to other DNA virus that replicate within the nucleus such as Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ).

In this study, we have studied the effects of a small panel of small fragments of the D. melanogaster X-chromosome on hybrid viability in three kinds of hybrid males. D. melanogaster and D. santomea are the two most divergent groups of D. melanogaster, while D. melanogaster and D. mauritiana are the two most divergent groups of D. melanogaster. We find that the X-chromosome from D. melanogaster carries dominant alleles that are lethal in hybrids, and more of these alleles are revealed in the most divergent cross. Our results reveal the existence of dominant alleles on the X-chromosome of D. melanogaster that cause lethality in three different interspecific hybrids. These alleles only cause inviability in hybrid males, yet have little effect in hybrid females. Our results suggest that X-linked elements that cause hybrid inviability in males might not do so in hybrid females due to differing sex chromosome interactions."

It is estimated that 27. 6% of the world population is infected with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. However, only 15% of the infected people progress to develop the most common cancer, prostate cancer. SAM-pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor ( SPDEF ) is expressed in normal prostate epithelium and is required for the progression of prostate cancer in vivo. SPDEF is known to function as a tumor suppressor. In the present study, we generated transgenic mice with the loss- or gain-of-function of SPDEF in prostate epithelium to demonstrate that SPDEF functions as tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Over-expression of SPDEF in prostate epithelium inhibited the progression of the cells and reduced their proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the crosstalk between SPDEF and Foxm1, a transcription factor critical for tumor cell proliferation, was required for the progression of prostate cancer in vivo. We also demonstrated that Foxm1 over-expression repressed the cellular proliferation of prostate tumor cells. Altogether, our study has identified novel crosstalk between SPDEF and Foxm1 and demonstrated that this crosstalk is required for the progression of prostate cancer in vivo."

Several pterosaur species are used as a method to draw conclusions about the living world from fossils and other skeletal and biological data. Using physical and mathematical models of Rynchops, a pterosaur species that is extinct, and a mathematical model of the Rynchops' bones and wings, we show that skimming is considerably more energetically costly than previously thought and that pterosaur species that have been suggested to be extinct were not always the skimming bird.

We focused on \u201ctrans-eQTL bands\u201d, defined as instances in which the expression patterns of many genes were all associated to a common genetic locus. Genes comprising trans-eQTL bands were screened for enriched functional gene sets representing known biological pathways, and genes located at associated trans-eQTL band loci were considered candidate transcriptional modulators. We demonstrate that these patterns were enriched for known relationships between known upstream transcriptional regulators and their downstream target genes. Moreover, we used this approach to identify both novel regulators and novel members of known pathways. Finally, based on a putative regulatory relationship identified in our analysis, we identified and validated a novel role for cyclin H in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation. We believe that the specific molecular hypotheses generated in this study will reveal many additional pathway members and regulators, and that the analysis approaches described herein will be broadly applicable to other eQTL data sets."

Since 2009, Egypt has unexpectedly had the highest number of human cases of H5N1 virus infection, with more than 50% of the total human cases, but the basis for this high incidence has not been elucidated. A change in receptor binding affinity of the viral hemagglutinin ( HA ) from \u03b12, 3- to \u03b12, 6-linked sialic acid ( SA ) is thought to be necessary for H5N1 virus to become pandemic. In this study, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of H5N1 viruses isolated between 2006 and 2009 in Egypt. The results showed that recent human isolates clustered into several new H5 sublineages suggesting that their HAs have changed their receptor specificity. Using reverse genetics, we found that these H5 sublineages have acquired an enhanced binding affinity for \u03b12, 6 SA in combination with residual affinity for \u03b12, 3 SA, and identified the amino acid mutations that produced this new receptor specificity. These findings correlated with enhanced virulence of the mutant viruses in mice. Interestingly, these H5 viruses, with increased binding to \u03b12, 6 SA, emerged during viral diversification in bird populations and subsequently spread to humans. Our findings suggested that emergence of new H5 sublineages with \u03b12, 6 SA specificity caused a subsequent increase in human H5N1 influenza virus infections in Egypt, and provided data for understanding the virus's pandemic potential."

Plants lacking UCN activity show spontaneous formation of ectopic multicellular protrusions in integuments and malformed petals indicating that UCN suppresses uncontrolled growth in those tissues. In the current model UCN regulates planar growth of integuments in part by directly repressing the putative transcription factor ABERRANT TESTA SHAPE (ATS ). Here we identify 3-PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 1 ( PDK1 ) as a novel factor involved in UCN-mediated growth control. Furthermore, our data indicate that PDK1 is an evolutionarily conserved growth factor that regulates cellular growth in a broad range of organisms.

Quantitative mass spectrometry analyses, comparing lamin A/C isolated from cells infected with viruses either expressing or lacking UL97 activity, revealed UL97-dependent phosphorylation of lamin A/C on the serine at residue 22 ( Ser22 ). Transient treatment of HCMV-infected cells with maribavir, an inhibitor of UL97 kinase activity, reduced lamin A/C phosphorylation by approximately 50%. Phosphorylation of lamin A/C during viral replication was accompanied by changes in the shape of the nucleus, as well as thinning, invaginations, and discrete breaks in the nuclear lamina, all of which required UL97 activity. As Ser22 is a phosphorylation site of particularly strong relevance for lamin A/C disassembly, our data support a model wherein viral mimicry of a mitotic host cell kinase activity promotes nuclear egress while accommodating viral arrest of the cell cycle."

The fungal wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola causes septoria tritici blotch, a disease that greatly reduces the yield and quality of wheat. Understanding how the fungus evades host defenses is important to designing strategies to control the disease. Here, we have sequenced the genome of M. graminicola. This genome is very different from that of the other sequenced plant-pathogenic fungi and has a number of features, such as high rate of intra-chromosomal rearrangement, that have been observed in only a few species. Surprisingly, the M. graminicola genome contains very few genes for enzymes that break down plant cell walls, which is very different from other organisms. This suggests that the stealth pathogenesis of M. graminicola involves degradation of proteins rather than carbohydrates to evade host defenses during the biotrophic stage of infection."

The termination of transcription, which is achieved by cleavage of the transcript at the 3\u2032 end, is a critical step for the correct termination of transcription. The cleavage factor 1A ( CF1A ) complex, which is required for the termination of transcription in budding yeast, occupies the 3\u2032 end of transcriptionally active genes. We recently demonstrated that CF1A subunits also crosslink to the 5\u2032 end of genes during transcription. The presence of CF1A complex at the promoter suggested its possible involvement in the initiation/reinitiation of transcription. In this study, we demonstrate that the CF1A complex is required for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II onto the promoter for reinitiation of transcription. Simultaneously, an increase in the synthesis of promoter-initiated divergent antisense transcript was observed in the clp1 mutant, suggesting that CF1A complex is involved in the regulation of directionality to the promoter-associated transcription. Chromosome conformation capture analysis revealed a physical interaction of the promoter and terminator regions of a gene in the presence of a functional CF1A complex."

The bacterial phylum Firmicutes is especially apt for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, and is the most prevalent cause of antibiotic resistance worldwide. HGT is initiated by the recognition of the presence of a new type of DNA molecule, the single-stranded DNA molecule, which is transferred from donor to recipient cell via a specific channel. The active site of the bacterial relaxase, named RelLS20, is located on the template strand of the conjugation genes. This is the first report of a bacterial family of the same kind. Our results show that RelLS20 is essential for conjugation and is located near the template strand of the conjugation genes. Surprisingly, the RelLS20 is not related to any other known proteins of bacterial phyla. We further show that RelLS20 is encoded almost exclusively in Firmicutes bacteria. Thus, this novel family of relaxases will have an important impact in different aspects of future research in the field of HGT in Gram-positive bacteria in general, and in gut microbiome research."

Here we show that human influenza is subject to strong natural selection against a number of sites in its genome that are known to be targets of human immune cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These sites are enriched with epitopes that are also targets of human immune system evolution.

Food availability is sensed by a number of neurons, including the cilia, which are the projections of the cell that extend to the environment.

When this channel is inactivated, the survival of C. elegans first larvae is significantly increased, but this extension extends only to a small subset of neurons. Furthermore, when this channel is inactivated, the lifespan of the first larva is also significantly increased. Interestingly, although insulin signaling modulates lifespan and food availability in a variety of organisms, these mechanisms do not appear to affect C. elegans neurosecretion.

We found that the two new cases were from the same strain, indicating that transmission is by the same strain, and not by new strain, and that this strain has been maintained in the community for a long time. We also found that the two strains, and the index case, are closely related, suggesting that transmission is direct or indirect. Our results confirm that people with leprosy are at high risk of contracting the disease, and that follow-up of these high-risk groups is a good strategy to diagnose and control the disease."

MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ), including miR-29 family, have been identified as important modulators of gene expression and function in the heart. Here, we studied the role of miR-29 in the cardiovascular system and its contribution to HF development. Using a conditional knock-out approach, we found that the absence of miR-29 in mice results in the development of vascular remodeling and systemic hypertension, as well as HF with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF ). We also demonstrated that miR-29 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, and that the lack of miR-29 triggers the up-regulation of its target, the master metabolic regulator PGC1\u03b1, which in turn generates profound alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to the accumulation of small mitochondria in mutant animals that contribute to cardiac disease. Finally, we demonstrated that systemic hypertension and HFpEF can be rescued by PGC1\u03b1 haploinsufficiency, which reduces cardiac mitochondrial accumulation and extends longevity of miR-29\u2013mutant mice. In addition, PGC1\u03b1 is overexpressed in hearts from patients with HF. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the in vivo function of miR-29 in the cardiovascular system and identify a novel miR-29/PGC1\u03b1 regulatory circuitry of functional relevance for cell metabolism under normal and pathological conditions."

We show how the emergence of collective migration propagates from the wound edge and is amplified by Met activation with hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor.

However, each of the six pandemics since 1889 emerged in the Northern Hemisphere just after the flu season, suggesting that pandemic timing may be predictable. Using a simple model fit to seasonal flu surveillance data from the United States, we find that seasonal flu leaves a transient wake of heterosubtypic immunity that impedes the emergence of novel flu viruses. This refractory period provides a simple explanation for not only the spring-summer timing of historical pandemics, but also early increases in pandemic severity and multiple waves of transmission. Thus, pandemic risk may be seasonal and predictable, with the accuracy of pre-pandemic and real-time risk assessments hinging on reliable seasonal influenza surveillance and precise estimates of the breadth and duration of heterosubtypic immunity."

We have previously shown that Trypanosoma brucei can interact with heart muscle cells ( cardiomyocytes ) to induce ventricular arrhythmias in ex vivo adult rat hearts. However, it is not known whether the cardiac dysfunction observed in vivo is also present during in vivo infection in experimental animal models. Here we show for the first time the characterisation of cardiac dysfunction in two animal models of AT using electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring. The first model used a commonly used laboratory strain, Trypanosoma brucei Lister 427, whilst the second model used a pleomorphic laboratory strain, T. b. brucei TREU 927, which demonstrates a similar chronic infection profile to clinical cases of AT. The frequency of ventricular arrhythmias and heart rate were significantly increased in the TREU 927 infection model in vivo, but not in the Lister 427 infection model. At the end of infection, hearts from both models were isolated and Langendorff perfused ex vivo with increasing concentrations of the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Interestingly, the increased frequency of arrhythmias observed in vivo in the TREU 927 infection model was lost upon isolation of the heart ex vivo, but re-emerged with the addition of isoproterenol. Our results demonstrate that TREU 927 infection modifies the substrate of the myocardium in such a way as to increase the propensity for ventricular arrhythmias in response to a circulating factor in vivo or \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation ex vivo. The TREU 927 infection model provides a new opportunity to accelerate our understanding of AT-related cardiac pathophysiology and to identify future treatment strategies."

However, the current standard treatment regimens are designed to treat only one type of infection. As a result, there is a high turnover in antibiotic use. If bacteria are resistant to all antibiotics, it is important to reduce antibiotic prescription. One of the proposed strategies to reduce antibiotic use is to restrict each drug separately. We use a mathematical model to investigate the efficiency of such antibiotic restrictions. We consider a scenario where one of the drugs is prescribed to all patients. The model is used to estimate realistic single and double antibiotic resistance frequencies in incoming patients. We find that broad usage of the hitherto restricted drug can reduce the number of incorrectly treated patients, and reduce the spread of bacteria resistant to both common antibiotics. Thus, counterintuitively, a broader usage of a formerly restricted drug can sometimes lead to a decrease in the emergence of bacteria resistant to all drugs."

Treatment of disseminated Candida albicans infections is hampered by the lack of vaccines against fungal pathogens. One of the key mediators of protection against fungal invasion is IL-17, which drives the expression of several antifungal proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the KKS, a novel mediator of IL-17-mediated protection against fungal invasion, also plays an important role in the protection from kidney failure caused by C. albicans infection. The KKS provides significant renal protection in mice lacking IL-17. Furthermore, therapeutic manipulation of IL-17-KKS pathways restored renal function and prolonged survival following C. albicans infection. Our study thus uncovers a novel function for IL-17 in protecting against fungal invasion of the kidney, and suggests that drugs targeting the KKS could be developed to improve the treatment of life-threatening disseminated infections caused by C. albicans."

We investigated this mechanism in the mammalian clock by computationally modeling coupling mediated by the primary neuropeptide, Vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ), and its receptor, VPAC2R. We found that synchrony can only be achieved if the level of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide is in-phase with the action of Per, a core clock component. Moreover, experimentally observed rhythms in VPAC2R can improve the amplitude of the network rhythms while narrowing the network entrainment range. We further show that these findings are valid across several network models. More generally, the phase of coupling is as critical as the strength of coupling from the viewpoint of synchrony and entrainment."

In this study, we have identified a novel mechanism of the activation of the gene family by SHB1.

We have demonstrated that OMV containing MID and DNA are responsible for induction of full B cell activation by TLR9. Importantly, this concept was verified in a 9-year old patient suffering from Moraxella sinusitis."

While the host immune response that controls the primary lesions is well known, the factors that influence the progression of LCL to ML are not completely understood. In this manuscript, we compare the gene expression profiles of primary cutaneous lesions from patients who eventually developed ML to those that did not. Our results suggest that lesions from LCL patients displayed a general multi-polarization of the adaptive immune response and showed up-regulation of genes involved in chemoattraction of innate immune cells and in antigen presentation. We also identified a potential transcriptional signature in the primary lesions that may predict long-term disease outcome. We were able to simultaneously sequence both human and Leishmania transcriptomes in primary cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions. Our results suggest an intrinsic difference in the immune capacity of LCL and ML patients."

The RV-C receptor is unique to the airway epithelium and does not bind ICAM-1 or LDL receptors. A single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in CDHR3, a member of the cadherin-related family of proteins, is among the strongest known genetic correlates for childhood virus-induced asthma susceptibility. In this study, we characterized RV-C binding to cell surfaces and show that the C529 and Y529 variants in the extracellular repeat domain 5 ( EC5 ), bound equivalently to virus, mapped the amino-terminal EC1 unit.

Here we report that JMJD6 is physically associated with the tumor suppressor p53. We demonstrated that JMJD6 acts as an \u03b1-ketoglutarate\u2013 and Fe ( II ) -dependent lysyl hydroxylase to catalyze p53 hydroxylation. We found that p53 indeed exists as a hydroxylated protein in vivo and that the hydroxylation occurs mainly on lysine 382 of p53. We show that JMJD6 antagonizes p53 acetylation, promotes the association of p53 with its negative regulator MDMX, and represses transcriptional activity of p53. Knockdown of JMJD6 enhances p53 transcriptional activity, arrests cells in the G1 phase, promotes cell apoptosis, and sensitizes cells to DNA damaging agent-induced cell death. Importantly, knockdown of JMJD6 represses p53-dependent colon cancer, and high nuclear JMJD6 protein is strongly correlated with aggressive clinical behaviors of colon adenocarcinomas.

Besides their role in innate immunity, PMNs may also participate in the regulation of adaptive immunity. To investigate the influence of PMNs in the immune response during chronic bacterial infections, we used a mouse model of brucellosis, caused by the intracellular bacterium Brucella abortus. We demonstrate that at later times of infection, Brucella abortus is killed more efficiently in the absence of PMNs than in their presence. This effect was accompanied by a significant reduction in spleen swelling and enhanced infiltration of epithelioid histiocytes ( a type of immune system cell ) corresponding to macrophages/dendritic cells. Moreover, monocytes and monocyte/DCs were recruited during the course of infection. Finally, we demonstrate that PMNs exert a suppressive effect on Th1-mediated B and T lymphocyte activation and Th2-mediated activation of the INF-\u03b3 pathway. These results reveal that PMNs have an unexpected influence in dampening the immune response against intracellular Brucella infection and strengthen the notion that PMNs actively participate in regulatory circuits shaping both innate and adaptive immunity."

The importance of synapses in information processing is emphasized by recent studies that reveal their role in shaping the information flow in sensory cortex. However, the precise mechanisms of how information flow is shaped by synapses remain largely unknown. In this work, we developed a computational model of the cortical microcircuit and then applied it to a large set of computer simulations and experimental data to investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying the computation of the rate of change. We found that the rate of change computation emerges through a combination of two ubiquitous brain mechanisms: short-term synaptic depression and spike-frequency adaptation. We then show how this rate-of-change circuit can be embedded in a convergently connected network to anticipate temporally incoming synaptic inputs, in quantitative agreement with experimental findings on anticipatory responses to moving stimuli in the primary visual cortex. Given the robustness of the mechanism and the widespread nature of the physiological machinery involved, we suggest that rate-of-change computation and temporal anticipation are principal, hard-wired functions of neural information processing in the cortical microcircuit."

In this study, we investigated the factors that influence the uptake of rabies control measures by individual dog owners in the area.

Moreover, 68% of the dog owners had a high level of knowledge about available rabies control measures. Our results showed that dog owners from the high risk areas had the highest level of knowledge about rabies and most of them had a good economy to catch their dogs. The most important reasons not to join the vaccination campaign were lack of information about the vaccination campaign and difficulty to catch the dog during the vaccination campaign. We also found that dog owners from the high risk areas had a higher level of knowledge about rabies and their control, but this was not associated with their participation in the vaccination campaign.

The activity of these factors is often regulated at the transcriptional level, and we have identified the transcription factor Klf6 as a novel growth factor that controls the expression of other myelination-promoting growth factors. Klf6 is rapidly induced in oligodendrocyte progenitors, and promotes differentiation. Conversely, the absence of Klf6 in mice results in a strong reduction in oligodendrocyte progenitors and subsequent apoptosis. Analysis of the genome reveals that Klf6 is required at the nexus of nuclear trafficking and the nuclear import pathway. This interaction is required for Klf6 to promote differentiation and viability. Thus, Klf6 is a novel growth factor that regulates myelination in vivo."

We demonstrate the process of homeostasis using a computational model that accounts for the feedback loop. We show that the stability of this system will typically increase with an increase in biological diversity and that the number of attractors within the phase space exponentially increases with the number of environmental variables while the probability of the system being in an attractor that lies within prescribed boundaries decreases approximately linearly.

We hypothesize that intronic variants within splicing regulatory elements may be responsible for the etiology of complex traits and may contribute to the inter-individual variability in the ratios of alternative transcripts. Using high-throughput experimental profiling, we experimentally validate our predictions of skipped exons and the role of intronic variants in alternative splicing in the context of complex human traits and diseases. We propose that intronic variants play a role as genetic regulators within splicing regulatory elements and show that their associated exon skipping events can affect protein domains and structure. Our results suggest that, in complex traits, splicing regulatory variation is a significant contributor to the etiology of complex diseases and that the inter-individual variability in the ratios of alternative transcripts may be partly explained by the effects of intronic variants on alternative splicing."

Here, we report that two bHLH transcription factors, AtCFL1 associated protein 1 ( CFLAP1 ) and CFLAP2, are also involved in AtCFL1-mediated regulation of cuticle development. Overexpression of either CFLAP1 or CFLAP2 led to expressional changes of genes involved in fatty acids, cutin and wax biosynthesis pathways and caused multiple cuticle defective phenotypes such as organ fusion, breakage of the cuticle layer and decreased epicuticular wax crystal loading. Functional inactivation of CFLAP1 and CFLAP2 by chimeric repression technology caused opposite phenotypes to the CFLAP1 overexpressor plants. Interestingly, we find that, similar to the transcription factor HDG1, the function of CFLAP1 in cuticle development is dependent on the presence of AtCFL1. Furthermore, both HDG1 and CFLAP1/2 interact with the same C4 zinc finger domain of AtCFL1, a domain that is essential for AtCFL1 function.

We also find that a gene, SOS1, is altered in melanoma, and a variant of SOS1 in ACVR1 is associated with Noonan syndrome, a genetic disease that causes retinal degeneration. We demonstrate the ability of our method to identify potential cancer-associated genes by analyzing multiple cancer exomes."

The majority of HBV infection occurs in the context of chronic liver disease, and there are no treatments currently available. The Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport ( ESCRT ) is an important cellular machinery that is known to be involved in the sorting and trafficking of ubiquitinated cargos. We have previously shown that the ESCRT-0 complex is involved in the trafficking of HBV RNA and DNA to the cell periphery. In this study, we have examined the potential effect of the ESCRT-0 complex on HBV transcription, replication and virion secretion. We focused on HGS, an ESCRT factor involved in the regulation of intracellular nucleocapsids. We found that HGS is important for HBV replication and virion secretion. Furthermore, HGS is involved in the secretion of HBV naked capsids, but not in the release of virions with empty nucleocapsids. The association between HGS and HBc appears to be ubiquitin-independent. Our results demonstrate the importance of an optimum level of HGS in HBV propagation."

Here, we describe a novel means for the acquisition of undifferentiated stem cells from differentiated cells, namely neural stem ( NS ) cells. NS cells can be activated and reprogrammed by a single round of transcription and translation, and then retain their differentiated state and differentiate into a new cell type. We report that this process is governed by two distinct signalling pathways, one through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the other through the glycosylate synthase pathway. We show that these pathways function in parallel and independently to promote reprogramming. NS cells are able to take up a differentiated state and retain their differentiated state, and are thus capable of acquiring a new cell type. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cellular differentiation."

In the past, network models have been used to fit a wide variety of sexual contact networks, but their ability to reproduce sexual contact data from real populations is still not well understood. We used a simulation model of a sexual contact network, in which we explored the role of behavioral heterogeneity of simulated individuals on the ability of the model to reproduce population-level sexual survey data from the Netherlands and UK. We find that a high level of heterogeneity in the ability of individuals to acquire and maintain ( additional ) partners strongly facilitates the ability of the model to accurately simulate the power-law distribution of the lifetime number of partners, and the age at which these partnerships were acquired, as surveyed in actual sexual contact networks. We also find that epidemiological measures on disease prevalence in survey data can be used as a powerful tool for building accurate sexual contact networks, as these measures provide information on the level of mixing between individuals of different levels of sexual activity in the population, a parameter that is hard to acquire through surveying individuals."

PfEMP1 is the most important determinant of virulence, and is the only antigen that mediates immune evasion and causes severe disease in humans. Understanding the relationship between the number of PfEMP1 antigenic domains and infection outcome is complicated by the fact that var genes encode highly polymorphic antigenic domains with variable binding specificities. Here, we use an evolutionary approach to show how the number of PfEMP1 domains and their variation in sequence are related to host immune selection pressure. We show that var genes can be grouped into two groups based on their evolutionary relationships and show how evolutionary mechanisms may have shaped the var gene repertoire.

These viruses require host factors and various lipids to form viral replication complexes. One such lipids is phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ), which is enriched in the viral replication compartment through a previously unknown mechanism. To unravel the mechanism of PE enrichment within the viral replication compartment, in this paper, the authors demonstrate that TBSV co-opts the guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) -bound active form of the endosomal Rab5 small GTPase via direct interaction with the viral replication protein. This interaction is mediated by the conserved Rab5 ortholog in a yeast model host or expression of dominant negative mutants of plant Rab5, which greatly decreases TBSV replication and prevents the redistribution of PE to the sites of viral replication. We also show that enrichment of PE in the viral replication compartment is assisted by actin filaments. Interestingly, the closely related Carnation Italian ringspot virus, which replicates on the boundary membrane of mitochondria, uses a similar strategy to the peroxisomal TBSV to hijack the Rab5-positive endosomes into the viral replication compartments. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the Rab family of small GTPases includes critical host factors assisting VRC assembly and genesis of the viral replication compartment."

These include reduced stress-protective genes in somatic stem cell lineages and over-expression of stress-protective genes in intestinal stem cell lineages. Interestingly, proliferative activity in aging intestinal epithelia correlates with longevity over a range of genotypes, with maximal lifespan when intestinal proliferation is reduced but not completely inhibited.

However, the phosphotransferase branches in the pathway are interconnected through a series of chemical modifications, and each branch transfers its own small molecule substrate to the acceptor site. The net effect is the inhibition of the acceptor reaction, which is the next step in the pathway. In this work, we investigate how the phosphotransferase network senses the overall influx of sugars in the cell and how this is integrated with other cellular metabolic inputs. We find that despite the seemingly complex network structure, the phosphotransferase network senses the overall influx of sugars in a simple manner, and integrates several other important inputs to regulate the network output. We also show that the integration of these inputs results in enhanced regulation of the next steps of the pathway."

Instead, we show that the frequency of mutations conferring resistance to both rifampicin and an additional antibiotic ( nalidixic-acid ) increases in aging compared to young colonies. We then use whole genome sequencing to demonstrate that these mutations cannot explain the increased frequency of resistance to both antibiotics. We further demonstrate that, as was previously shown for rifampicin resistance mutations, mutations conferring nalidixic acid resistance can also increase fitness in aging compared to young colonies. Our results show that increases in the frequency of antibiotic resistant mutations in aging colonies cannot be seen as evidence of increased mutation rates.

Here, we examine how flexibility is related to the binding of a small molecule, ligand, to a protein. We show that, while the structural changes upon binding are relatively large, the induced changes are smaller. This makes it difficult to predict ligand effects on protein flexibility. However, we can predict the effects of ligand binding on conformation changes, which allows us to predict which changes are most likely. We show that the induced flexibility is not a simple matter of structure similarity, but rather a function of the amino acid sequence of the protein and its ligand. Our results have implications for the rational design of drugs that bind to a given protein and will help in rational drug design."

Here, we systematically identify multi-gene chromatin domains in the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We constructed a compendium of genome-scale binding maps for a broad panel of chromatin-associated proteins. We then computationally analyzed this compendium for evidence of multi-gene chromatin domains using a novel statistical segmentation algorithm. Our results indicate that at least 50% of all fly genes are organized into chromatin domains, which often consist of dozens of genes. The domains are characterized by various known and novel combinations of chromatin proteins. Furthermore, during evolution fewer chromosomal rearrangements occur inside chromatin domains than outside domains. Our results provide the first global view of the chromatin organization of multi-gene chromatin domains in eukaryotes."

It consists of two components: Cas-proteins that cleave the foreign DNA and the CRISPR array that suits as a virus recognition key. Here, we estimate the number of spacers in a CRISPR array of a prokaryotic cell which maximizes its protection against a viral attack by using optimization techniques from the competition between two trends: too few spacers make the host vulnerable to an attack by a virus with mutated corresponding protospacers, while an excessive variety of spacers dilutes the number of the CRISPR complexes armed with the most recent and thus most useful spacers. We find that depending on such parameters as the concentration of CRISPR-Cas interference complexes and its preference to arm with more recently acquired spacers, the rate of viral mutation, and the number of viral species, the predicted optimal number of spacers lies within a range that agrees with experimentally-observed values."

However, the brain has to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the brain anatomy and physiology to execute a coherent behavior on the time scale of seconds. How the brain can overcome this hurdle is an open question. Here we show that excitable neuronal assemblies can serve as a building block for rapid and reliable execution of neural circuit function. These assemblies can flexibly adjust the speed of execution of neural circuit function in order to support reliable behavior on this time scale. We argue that the propagation speed of neuronal circuits is slower than the speed of action potential propagation, and that this difference is a fundamental difference between neural circuits and motor circuits. We show in simulations and in vivo experiments that the propagation speed of neuronal circuits is slower than the speed of action potential propagation, and show how various patterns of activity propagation can be explained."

ASFV is also highly infectious in humans, causing an estimated 40, 000 deaths per year. ASFV replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. ASFV modulates the host cell to facilitate viral replication and spread, and it is known that this process is modulated by viral proteins. Here, we show that a number of viral proteins, including eIF4G, eIF4E, eIF4B, eIF4E, 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, are involved in the regulation of the host translation machinery. In particular, eIF4F and eIF4E are involved in the modification of the host translation machinery, thereby affecting the viral protein synthesis. In addition, eIF4F and eIF4E are localized in the periphery of viral factories, and this organization is correlated with the presence of viral late mRNAs. Our results demonstrate that the host translation machinery, which is involved in viral protein synthesis, is also involved in the inhibition of host protein synthesis, thereby facilitating ASFV protein production."

Purified OMVs contained primarily outer membrane proteins including oligomeric PorB. The porin was targeted to mitochondria of macrophages after exposure to purified OMVs and wild type N. gonorrhoeae. This was associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of apoptotic caspases and cell death in a time-dependent manner. Consistent with this, OMV-induced macrophage death was prevented with the pan-caspase inhibitor, Q-VD-PH. This shows that N. gonorrhoeae utilizes OMVs to target PorB to mitochondria and induce apoptosis in macrophages, thus affecting innate immunity."

The kinetics and energetics of the process as well as how it proceeds with substantial conformational changes of the polymerase complex determine the mechano-chemical coupling mechanism of the transcription elongation. Here, we investigated detailed dynamics of the PPi release process in a single-subunit RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) from bacteriophage T7, implementing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We obtained a jump(from-cavity kinetic model of the PPi release utilizing extensive nanosecond MD simulations. We found that the PPi release in T7 RNAP is initiated by the PPi dissociation from two catalytic aspartic acids, followed by a comparatively slow jump-from-cavity activation process. Combining with a number of long MD simulations, we also found that the activation is hindered by charged residue associations as well as by local steric and hydrogen bond interactions. On the other hand, the activation is greatly assisted by a highly flexible lysine residue Lys472 that swings its side chain to pull PPi out. The mechanism can apply in general to single subunit RNA and DNA polymerases with similar molecular structures and conserved key residues. Remarkably, the flexible lysine residue or arginine residue appears to be a universal module that assists the PPi release even in multi-subunit RNAPs with charge facilitated hopping mechanisms. Our study thus supports the Brownian ratchet scenario of the mechano-chemical coupling in the transcription elongation of the single-subunit polymerase."

Directly blocking either Fgf or Notch signaling causes less dramatic acceleration of SAG neural development without neuronal death, whereas blocking both pathways mimics effects that are reversed by overexpression of Tfap2a.

The HBV genome is organised in a multigene family, comprising 17 genes that encode proteins with various functions. Some of these genes show striking association with autoimmune diseases, whereas others appear to be important in antigen presentation. In chickens, a single gene, B12, which is part of the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ), is associated with one or two autoimmune diseases. Here, we use whole genome sequence analysis and a combination of functional and biochemical analyses to show that the B12 gene family is dynamic expanding and contracting. This expansion is likely driven by two major evolutionary forces\u2014combination and/or deletion\u2014of the B12 gene region, which may be driven by other major evolutionary forces. Our analysis also suggests that the B12 gene family in chickens is undergoing much more rapid evolution than in mammals."

Viruses such as rotavirus, adenovirus, and caliciviruses are a major cause of childhood illness, but in many patients a causal agent cannot be found despite extensive diagnostic testing. We investigated a case-control study of pediatric disease caused by viruses found in the Bocavirus genus, to identify a novel virus. We used molecular testing to amplify viral DNA from fecal specimens, and then sequenced the DNA to determine its origin. A novel virus was detected in one of the children. We have named this novel virus HBoV2. HBoV2 prevalence was greater than that of rotavirus in children, and it was higher than that of adenovirus in children with signs of disease. The prevalence of HBoV2 was also greater than that of rotavirus in children with signs of disease, and it was not associated with age. We have detected HBoV2 in two additional cases of childhood disease. These findings provide new insight into the biology of Bocavirus, and may help in the development of new therapeutic strategies for this important group of viral infections."

Starting with a comparison of microarray gene expression profiles for a new dataset of 189 healthy adult participants in the Emory- Georgia Tech Center for Health Discovery and Well-Being ( CHDWB ) cohort, with a previously published study of 208 adult Moroccans, we identify nine axes each with between 99 and 1, 028 strongly co-regulated transcripts in common. Each axis is enriched for gene ontology categories related to sub-classes of blood and immune function, including T-cell and B-cell physiology and innate, adaptive, and anti-viral responses. We show that environmental factors, including lifestyle differences in Morocco and infection leading to active or latent tuberculosis, significantly impact specific axes, but that there is also significant heritability for the axis scores. In the context of personalized medicine, reanalysis of the longitudinal profile of one individual during and after infection with two respiratory viruses demonstrates that specific axes also characterize clinical incidents. This mode of analysis suggests the view that, rather than unique subsets of genes marking each class of disease, differential expression reflects movement along the major normal axes in response to environmental and genetic stimuli."

Elevated d-Myc protein levels were a cause of tubular degeneration in BicC mutants. Activation of the Target of Rapamycin ( TOR ) kinase pathway, another common feature of PKD, was found in BicC mutant flies.

We also show that two bacterial flotillins, FloA and FloT, form complexes with other proteins in a similar way. However, we also show that these bacterial flotillin structures do not colocalize in a common microdomain, and consequently do not move together. We further show that these bacterial flotillin structures can be detected by electron microscopy. The analysis of their dynamics shows that FloA and FloT are not able to colocalize.

The model is simple and well-posed, and has been used to investigate the response to different inputs in different cell types. We have extended the model to incorporate the adaptation process and to investigate the effect of different inputs on bacterial chemotaxis. Our results show that optimal chemotaxis is observed in a narrow range of CheA kinase activity. We also show that the CheB phosphorylation feedback improves chemotaxis by shifting the average CheY-P concentration to fit the motor operating range. Our results suggest that in liquid media the variability in adaptation times among cells may be evolutionary favorable to ensure coexistence of subpopulations that will be optimally tactic in different gradients.

In lieu of identifying an immunodominant peptide expressed by GAS, a surrogate peptide ( 2W ) was fused to the M1 protein on the surface of GAS to allow in-depth analysis of the CD4+ helper T cell response in C57BL/6 mice that express the I-Ab MHCII molecule.

We found that simulated infections with the highest parasitemia tended to be those with ineffective innate immunity even if antibodies were present. We also compared infections with dyserythropoiesis ( reduced red blood cell production during infection ) to those with compensatory erythropoiesis ( boosted RBC production ) or a fixed basal RBC production rate. Dyserythropoiesis tended to reduce parasitemia slightly but at a cost to the host of aggravating anemia. Our simulations suggest that P. vivax can induce severe anemia as readily as P. falciparum for the same type of immune response, though P. vivax attacks a much smaller subset of RBCs. Since most P. vivax infections are nonlethal clinically, this suggests that P. falciparum adaptations for countering or evading immune responses are more effective than those of P. vivax."

The method is based on a top-down strategy, first identifying regions that are shared by all the input sequences, then aligning closely related subgroups in tandem. We show that the method is more accurate than existing methods. In particular, it infers gap penalties between indels and insertions in each sequence. This is the first time that a method based on a Bayesian statistical framework has been shown to be able to discriminate the relative positions of indels from insertions. We also show that the method is able to discriminate between conserved domains present in a large number of sequences, which is a useful feature to identify conserved protein domains. The method is widely used in the literature and is currently being applied to other protein sequences. We have used the method to analyze 408 protein sequences from NCBI Conserved Domain Database."

This response includes the recognition of virus-derived RNA by pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) and the production of type I interferons ( IFN\u03b2 ), which are crucial for the initiation of an anti-viral state. The induction of IFN\u03b2 is governed by a complex network of signalling cascades, including the PRRs and the RIG-I-like helicases ( RLHs ). In this study, we demonstrate that the Nemo-related protein, optineurin ( NRP/FIP2 ), has a role in the inhibition of virus-triggered IFN\u03b2 induction. Optineurin blocked IFN\u03b2 induction by several means, including the formation of a protein complex with TBK1 and TRAF3, and ubiquitination, which is essential for the correct sub-cellular localisation and the inhibitory function of optineurin. This work identifies optineurin as a critical regulator of antiviral signalling and potential target for future antiviral therapy."

We also found evidence of pre-existing DENV-2 antibodies being associated with an incomplete reduction in the frequency of symptoms.

Here, we have analyzed linker histone H1. 5 in human differentiated cells from all three embryonic germ layers but not embryonic stem cells. H1. 5 binds to both intergenic and genic regions of the genome in differentiated human cells, and we found that H1. 5 binds to genes that encode membrane and membrane-related proteins. Strikingly, H1. 5 binds to gene families that encode key components of chromatin. H1. 5 is required for repressing genes that encode membrane and membrane-related proteins. H1. 5 enrichment is also required for H3K9me2 enrichment, and is required for chromatin compaction. H1. 5 depletion results in loss of SIRT1 and H3K9me2, increased chromatin accessibility, deregulated gene expression, and decreased cell growth. Our data reveal for the first time a specific and novel function for linker histone H1. 5 in maintaining condensed chromatin at defined gene families in differentiated human cells."

We found that HCMV infection dramatically impaired the rate of neuronogenesis and strongly increased PPAR\u03b3 levels.

In the absence of PAR-2, matriptase and prostasin double deficiency leads to the absence of the placenta, a severe placental disease, and embryonic death. The combined loss of matriptase and PAR-2 also results in the absence of the placenta, a placental-like tissue, and embryo survival.

Despite the extensive co-localization of matriptase, prostasin, and PAR-2 in embryonic epithelia, the overall macroscopic and histological analysis of the double-deficient embryos did not reveal any obvious developmental abnormalities. In agreement with this, the combined deletion of matriptase from the embryo proper does not affect the prenatal development or survival of PAR-2-deficient mice, indicating that the critical redundant functions of matriptase/prostasin and PAR-2 are limited to extraembryonic tissues. Indeed, placental epithelium showed decreased vascularization, and the ability of placental epithelium to establish a functional feto-maternal barrier was severely diminished.

This method is based on the comparison of sequences from different genomes. The basic idea is to consider all possible pairwise alignments between two RNA sequences and use them to compute the probability that a given alignment is either identical ( pre-folding ) or similar ( pre-aligning ). We present the method in a series of algorithms that consider the three different possible types of alignments: ( i ) pre-folding and ( ii ) pre Aligning. In each of these algorithms, we have developed a new algorithm that considers all possible pairs of alignments. The algorithm is fast and computationally efficient, and has been implemented into a new FOLDesan algorithm. We have applied the algorithm to search for new ncRNAs in human and mouse cells. We have found several interesting new ncRNAs in these cells. We also provide an algorithm to divide the structure of the RNA into smaller unbranched segments. With these improvements in the algorithm, the FOLDesan algorithm package provides the molecular biologist with an efficient and user-friendly tool for searching for new ncRNAs."

The emergence of resistant vectors has increased the need to develop new control strategies. Among the most promising strategies is the development of resistance management strategies. These strategies are based on the analysis of the insecticide susceptibility mechanisms present in the vectors, in order to decrease the probability of resistance development. Three families of enzymes are known to mediate detoxification of xenobiotics, including insecticides. We have performed comparative analysis of gene expression patterns between the three triatomine families that have evolved high levels of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. Our results indicate that several insecticide resistance related gene families are reduced or lacking in triatomines from the Gran Chaco ecoregion, an area in which pyrethroid resistant vectors have failed. We also show that metabolic resistance may be a cause of pyrethroid resistance in wild Triatomine populations. Our results provide new information on the potential insecticide resistance mechanisms in vectors of Chagas\u2019 disease."

This can occur either through direct oxidation of DNA guanine or via incorporation of the oxidized nucleotide during replication. Hydrolases that degrade oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates normally minimize this incorporation. To investigate whether the incorporation of oxidized nucleic acid precursors contributes to neurodegeneration, we constructed a transgenic mouse in which the human hydrolase 8-oxodGTPase is expressed. We show that the expression of the human hMTH1 gene confers dramatic protection against the symptoms of Huntington's disease. We also show that an in vitro genetic model for Huntington's disease is used. We demonstrate that oxidized nucleic acid precursors are toxic in the huntingtin cell model, and that the toxicity is due to the expression of the mutant huntingtin gene. Our results implicate oxidized nucleic acid precursors in the neuropathological features of Huntington's disease and identify the utilization of oxidized nucleoside triphosphates by striatal cells as a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of this disorder."

The parasite is transmitted to humans by tsetse flies, which are highly efficient vectors. The parasites cycle between the insect host ( procyclic form ) and mammalian host ( bloodstream form ). While the genes and proteins of both forms are highly similar, they differ only in their sequence and expression patterns. The genes are subject to regulation by factors that induce the unfolded protein response ( UPR ), a conserved protein stress response pathway. UPR induces a protective protein, spliced leader RNA ( SL RNA ), that is cleaved by the 5\u2032 end exonuclease Cenricleucine ( Cen ). SL RNA silencing ( SLS ) elicits shut-off of spliced leader RNA transcription by perturbing the binding of Cen to its cognate promoter, thus eliminating trans-splicing of all mRNAs. Here, we show that ER stress induces SLS, leading to up-regulation of genes involved in protein translocation across the ER membrane. This mechanism is dependent on differential stabilization of mRNAs. When ER stress persists, SLS induces programmed cell death ( PCD ), evident by exposure of phosphatidyl serine, DNA laddering, increase in reactive oxygen species production, increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+, and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as typical morphological changes observed by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ). ER stress response is also induced in the bloodstream form and if the stress persists it leads to SLS. We propose that the ER stress response is a unique mechanism to induce SLS, which serves as a unique death pathway."

Here, we demonstrate that the existence of a set of synonymous DNA sequences that can explore different regions of the protein's adaptive landscape, in addition to their ability to change the protein's structure, can be an important feature for manipulating the evolution of natural proteins. We applied our algorithm to a gene that is responsible for antibiotic resistance and found that, when synthesized with multiple versions of the gene, the resulting variants were able to synthesize new functions that are different from the original gene.

These neurons are interconnected by specialized channels, the voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, which have been assembled from a common precursor in all vertebrates. The vertebrate nervous system is thought to have evolved from a common ancestor of all vertebrates. We have analyzed the evolution of the sodium channels that generate action potentials at the site of Ranvier, a key event in vertebrate nervous system evolution. We show that sodium channels acquired an anchor motif early in the chordate lineage ( a cephalochordate ), and then co-evolved with the cytoskeleton adaptor protein ankyrin-G, to form the sodium channel clusters that are present in most vertebrates. These early channel innovation appears essential to the complex nervous system, as vertebrates and other chordates lack myelin or myelin-like membranes, and to allow the rapid generation of action potentials."

Meanwhile, upregulation of miR-27b and downregulation of KSRP caused reciprocal alterations in iNOS mRNA stability.

Moreover, forced expression of KSRP and inhibition of miR-27b resulted in an increased burden of C. parvum infection. Downregulation of KSRP through upregulating miR-27b was also detected in epithelial cells following LPS stimulation.

We found that members of urban families were infected with H. pylori more frequently than members of rural families. In addition, we found evidence that H. pylori from different parts of the world are transmitted vertically from parent to child, and that some members of the South African families are infected with H. pylori from different parts of the world. Our results provide important insight into how H. pylori spreads in the developing world and show that transmission is likely to differ between rural and industrialized countries."

When a ribosome encounters a stop codon, it is precluded from translating the protein sequence. In this situation, the stop codon is recognized and a signal is induced to induce degradation of the misfolded protein. Here, we have investigated the mechanisms involved in the initial steps of protein degradation after the stop codon is recognized. We have found that a family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, called K63, can function in several distinct manners to control the degradation of the misfolded protein. These findings not only provide novel information regarding the detailed molecular mechanisms of the initial steps involved in protein degradation, but also have important implications for the classification of protein degradation pathways."

The process of folding is energetically expensive and involves a large number of steps. The folding reaction is driven by an inherent preference of the structure for a particular conformation, a phenomenon referred to as energetic frustration. In this work, we study the effects of energetic frustration on the folding of a protein structure, SH3. Our results show that the entropy of the chain is not responsible for the folding mechanism. Instead the preferred folding route arises from a cooperative energetic effect. Off-pathway structures are penalized by excess distortion in local backbone configurations and contact pair distances. This energy cost is a new ingredient in the malleable balance of interactions that controls the choice of routes during protein folding."

It is a complex process and requires multiple proteins and membranes to facilitate uptake. Phagocytosis occurs in a variety of cellular compartments, including the phagosome, the cellular enclosure that allows the uptake of intracellular pathogens. Phagosomes are often formed in the plasma membrane, a lipid-rich compartment, and their maturation is thought to be an essential event in phagocytosis. Phagosome maturation is initiated by the formation of a phosphoinositide ( PI ) 3, 5\u2019 2\u201d, which is produced by a number of enzymes. Here, we show that the PI 3, 5\u2019 2\u201d-associated phosphoinositide 5-kinase PIKfyve is essential for the delivery of two types of hydrolases to the phagosome: the V-ATPase and proteases. Lack of PIKfyve impairs the efficiency of the V-ATPase and protease delivery to the phagosome, leading to the inability of cells to acidify newly formed phagosomes and digest their contents. This defect is accompanied by a defect in the ability of cells lacking PIKfyve to efficiently kill captured bacteria. In summary, our results show that PIKfyve is required for the efficient delivery of hydrolases to the phagosome to ensure the efficient clearance of intracellular pathogens."

Here we describe a genetic screen for genes that act upstream of JNK to mediate apoptosis-induced proliferation. We have identified a subset of genes acting upstream of JNK and show that JNK signaling occurs both in apoptotic cells as well as in neighboring surviving cells. We also demonstrate that JNK activation occurs downstream of JNK signaling, a finding that implicates EGFR signaling as an important mediator of apoptosis-induced proliferation.

These data underscore the importance of genetic screening and promise an improved understanding of the mechanisms of apoptosis-induced proliferation."

This is often the case for the symbionts that protect insects against parasitic wasps. We investigated the role of a class of proteins, ribosome-inactivating proteins ( RIPs ), in protection by defensive symbionts against parasitic wasps in two species of fruit fly. We show that, in these species, we find strong evidence for a role for RIPs in protection against parasitic wasps. We also show that a specific RNA, called 28S rRNA, from parasitic wasps, Leptopilina, can be cleaved by ribosome-inactivating proteins. Interestingly, we find that a fly lineages called Pachycrepoideus inside the gut of a moth, which are known to be resistant to parasitic wasps, also escapes protection by ribosome-inactivating proteins. We also show that the genome of the Pachycrepoideus line encodes a diverse repertoire of RIP genes. This work suggests that specificity of defensive symbionts against different natural enemies may be driven by the evolution of toxin repertoires, and that toxin diversity may play a role in shaping host-symbiont-enemy interactions."

Our results indicated that the two subgenomes diverged in expression and regulation, which suggests that they have different functional capacities. However, we found that a large proportion of genes that were differentially expressed between the two subgenomes, were under trans-regulation reflecting the establishment of a new regulatory pattern. Parental dominance varied among tissues: expression in flowers was closer to that of C. orientalis and expression in root and leaf to that of C. grandiflora. Since deleterious mutations accumulated on the C. orientalis subgenome, the bias in expression towards C. orientalis seen in flowers indicates that expression changes could be adaptive and related to the selfing syndrome, while biases in the roots and leaves towards the C. grandiflora subgenome may be reflective of the differential genetic load."

During the latent-to-lytic switch, the viral genome is reorganized to rekindle expression of viral genes and to escape the host immune response. We found that KSHV LANA is a multifunctional protein that is used to evade host immune responses. During viral infection, the LANA protein is cleaved into two distinct fragments that are processed by the viral protease, caspase-1 and caspase-3. Using a cell-permeable peptide that spans both fragments, we demonstrated that cleavage of LANA is inhibited by a cell-permeable peptide.

In this study, we investigated the effect of sublethal exposure to niclosamide on the transcriptional responses of Biomphalaria glabrata, the snail Biomphalaria glabrata, relative to untreated snails. We found that most of the genes upregulated by exposure of snails to niclosamide are involved in biotransformation of xenobiotics, including genes encoding cytochrome P450s ( CYP ), glutathione S-transferases ( GST ), and drug transporters, notably multi-drug resistance protein ( efflux transporter ) and solute linked carrier ( influx transporter ). Niclosamide also induced stress responses. Genes encoding ADP-ribosylation factor ( ARF ), cAMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) and coatomer, all of which are involved in vesicle trafficking in the Golgi of mammalian cells, were also upregulated. Lastly, a hemoglobin gene was downregulated, suggesting niclosamide may affect oxygen transport.

Among the effector proteins, NleC, a metalloprotease, has been recently shown to modulate host NF-\u03baB signaling by cleaving NF-\u03baB Rel subunits. However, it remains elusive how NleC recognizes NF-\u03baB Rel subunits and how the NleC-mediated cleavage impacts on host immune responses in infected cells and animals. In this study, we show that NleC specifically cleaves p65/RelA through an interaction with a unique N-terminal sequence in p65. NleC cleaves p65 in intestinal epithelial cells, albeit a small percentage of the molecule, to generate the p651\u201338 fragment during C. rodentium infection in cultured cells. Moreover, the NleC-mediated p65 cleavage substantially affects the expression of a subset of NF-\u03baB target genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, immune cell infiltration in the colon, and tissue injury in C. rodentium-infected mice.

We have further addressed the impact of the mosquito's endogenous microbial flora on virus infection. Our results indicate that the Toll pathway, which is known to play a role in regulating resistance to a variety of viruses, is also involved in modulating the dengue virus infection, possibly through basal-level stimulation of the Toll immune pathway."

Each of the two major genogroups ( GI and GII ) of human NoVs recognizes a unique set of histocompatibility antigenic peptides through a distinct binding interface. Here, we characterize a new human Lewis a ( Lea ) antigen binding strain ( OIF virus ), which does not share the conserved GII binding interface, revealing a new evolutionary lineage with a distinct HBGA binding interface. Sequence alignment showed that the major residues contributing to the new HBGA binding interface are conserved among most members of the GII. 21, as well as a closely related GII. 13 genotype. In addition, we found that glycerol inhibits OIF binding to HBGAs, potentially allowing production of cheap antivirals against human NoVs. Taken together, our results reveal a new evolutionary lineage of NoVs with a distinct HBGA binding interface."

Importantly, blockade of HDAC activity renders nonresponsive cells susceptible to the pro-apoptotic activity of IFN-\u03bb, revealing the combination of HDAC inhibitors and IFN-\u03bb to be a potential antitumor strategy.

During the imposed \u201cremodeling\u201d of gene expression, changes in the levels of particular mRNAs do not necessarily correlate with those of the encoded proteins, which could in part rely on the differential recruitment of mRNAs to translating ribosomes. To systematically address this issue, we have established an approach to rapidly access the translational status of each mRNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by affinity purification of endogenously formed ribosomes and the analysis of associated mRNAs with DNA microarrays. Using this method, we compared changes in total mRNA levels ( transcriptome ) with ribosome associations ( translatome ) after the application of different conditions of cellular stress. We found that many of the regulated messages code for functionally related proteins, thus reflecting logical responses to the particular stress. In contrast, mild stress provoked by addition of Calcofluor-white and menadione altered the translatome of approximately 1% of messages with marginal effects on total mRNA. Our results suggest the presence of highly sensitive translational regulatory networks that coordinate functionally related messages."

We found that half of all dendritic spines are within 100\u00b5m of the soma. The probability of the two neurons intersecting given their inter-somatic distance, and that of their inputs from FSIs to MSNs, is consistent with current estimates. Our models also predict that FSIs should be at most 1% of the striatal population. We show that the striatum is sparsely connected: FSI-PET and MSN-PET contacts respectively form 7% and 1. 7% of all possible connections. Our models also show that the dominant GABAergic input to a MSN arises from neurons with somas at the edge of its dendritic field. FSIs are inter-connected on two different spatial scales: locally by gap junctions and distally by synapses. Our models thus intimately link striatal micro-anatomy to its dynamics, providing a biologically grounded platform for further study."

Cold temperature delayed reproductive aging. The anticonvulsant medicine ethosuximide delayed reproductive aging, indicating that neural activity can influence reproductive aging.

This suggests that a recent selective sweep at the APL1 locus may have driven these differences. In particular, the recent sweep at APL1 in M form mosquitoes is distinct from the recent selective sweep at the Lep1 locus, which only affects the M form.

Intense local pain is the major symptom reported after bites of P. nigriventer. However, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the mechanisms involved in nociception induced by the venom of P. nigriventer. We used a rodent model to detect the effects induced by the venom of P. nigriventer on the mouse paw. We found that the venom of P. nigriventer produced spontaneous nociception. This nociception is not dependent on glutamate or histamine receptors or on mast cell degranulation, but it is mediated by the stimulation of sensory fibres that contain serotonin 4 ( 5-HT4 ) and vanilloid receptors ( TRPV1 ). We also found a kallikrein-like kinin-generating enzyme activity in tissue treated with P. nigriventer venom, which also contributes to nociception. We also found that both low- and high-molecular-weight toxins of P. nigriventer produce spontaneous nociception through direct or indirect action of kinin B2, TRPV1, 5-HT4 or ASIC receptors and voltage-dependent sodium channels present in sensory neurons but not in mast cells. Understanding the mechanisms involved in nociception induced by P. nigriventer venom are of interest not only for better treating poisoning by P. nigriventer but also appreciating the diversity of targets triggered by PNV toxins."

The recent reports of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus populations in Turkey, in parallel with the territorial expansion identified in several countries, have raised concerns about the establishment and re-establishment of these invasive Aedes mosquitoes in Turkey. The purpose of this study was to detect Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus in regions of recent incursions, and screen for viruses known to be transmitted elsewhere by these species. Mosquitoes were collected at several locations in the Black Sea region, and identified via genetic and/or specific nucleic acid amplification assays. The study group comprised 791 specimens. Aedes albopictus was the most abundant species in all locations ( 89. 6% ), followed by Ae. aegypti ( 7. 8% ) and Culex pipiens ( 2. 5% ). In 4 ( 6. 2% ) and 6 ( 9. 2% ) pools, respectively, cell fusing agent virus ( CFAV ) and Aedes flavivirus ( AEFV ) sequences were characterized. In 3 ( 3. 6% ) and 6 ( 9. 2% ) pools, respectively, WNV was detected as strain \u201cMERDLVT\u201d, a newly described rhabdovirus, which was also co-detected in a Cx. pipiens pool. In our study, we show that these invasive Aedes species are established in certain locations of northeastern Turkey.

HSV-2 is a reactivating virus, which establishes a chronic infection in the host. A minority of episodes are prolonged, and associated with development of painful ulcers. However, currently, available tools poorly predict viral trajectories and timing of reactivations in infected individuals. In this study, we utilized principal components analysis ( PCA ) and singular value decomposition ( SVD ) to analyze HSV-2 shedding time series data, and used a spatial mathematical model to predict the dynamics of HSV-2 shedding. We found that, although modeling and clinical HSV-2 episodes had equivalent dynamics, model-derived and clinical episodes had equivalent dynamics. We also found that local immune cell density at the viral reactivation site had a predictive effect on episode duration, though longer term shedding suggested chaotic dynamics and could not be predicted based on spatial patterns of immune cell density. These findings suggest that HSV-2 shedding patterns within an individual are impossible to predict over weeks or months, and that even highly complex single HSV-2 episodes can only be partially predicted based on spatial distribution of immune cell density."

We developed a novel method for blood meal identification using peptide mass mapping ( PMM ) analysis of host-specific hemoglobin peptides from abdomens of engorged sand flies. This method provided correct host identification of 100% experimentally fed sand flies until 36h post blood meal and for 80% samples even 48h post blood meal. In females fed on two hosts, both blood meal sources were correctly assigned for 60% of specimens until 36h post blood meal. The method yielded unambiguous host determination for 96% of specimens. PMM-based MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis targeting host specific hemoglobin peptides represents a sensitive and cost-effective method with a fast and simple preparation protocol.

However, some bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, show a fast cell wall stress-induced transition, resulting in a very rapid engulfment of the forespore in the absence of cell wall. In this paper, we use a combination of fluorescence image analysis and stochastic Langevin simulations to explore the mechanisms underlying this fast engulfment. Our results suggest that the fast cell wall stress-induced transition is the product of a novel cell-wall independent mechanism that, in the absence of cell wall, engages the mother-cell protein SpoIIIAH to generate zipper-like engulfment.

We identified three genetic variants on 2p16. 1 ( rs10865291, rs6761893, and rs727878; P < 5\u00d710\u22128 ) in the EFEMP1 gene that encodes a secreted extracellular matrix protein implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell proliferation, and organogenesis. RNA expression analysis demonstrated that EFEMP1 is expressed in cholangiocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in liver specimens from patients with either biliary atresia or other cholestatic diseases, but is absent from cholangiocytes in normal control liver samples. EFEMP1 transcripts had higher expression in cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts as compared with other cell types in normal rat liver. The identification of a novel BA-associated locus, and implication of EFEMP1 as a new biliary atresia susceptibility gene, could provide new insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying this severe pediatric disorder."

It is also implicated in many cancers, including those caused by chromosomal aberrations such as those resulting from DNA translocations. When cells repair DNA double-strand breaks, a subset of the breaks can be bypassed using a non-homologous end joining repair pathway called c-NHEJ. Alternatively, in some cases, the breaks can be healed using a complementary DNA repair pathway called DNA crosslink repair ( Alt-EJ ). While it is known that both pathways are important for repairing DNA double-strand breaks, the mediators of such repair pathways are poorly understood. Here, we describe the first comprehensive analysis of factors important for c-NHEJ repair and identify several that are also important for Alt-EJ. These factors are from diverse pathways and are also found in the context of DNA crosslink repair. We further show that several of these factors are required for both repair pathways, and we find that loss of one factor can significantly alter the effect of others. Our data suggest that several DNA repair pathways are important for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and that c-NHEJ and resection are both important for the repair of these lesions."

Tracking performance increased with the strength of the coupling, which suggests that the worse partner followed the skilled one\u2019s lead, but simulations show that the results are better explained by a model where partners share movement goals through the forces, whilst the coupling dynamics determine the capacity of communicable information.

We tested the hypothesis that genes involved in energy metabolism are likely to be central to this process. To test the hypothesis, we developed a novel method for testing the hypothesis that the genetic variation that is observed in humans in the 52 human populations is correlated with variation in climate. We genotyped the 52 in the human genome and the 210 carefully matched control genome for a variety of climatic conditions to show that the genetic variation in the genes that we tested is significantly correlated with climatic variation. The strongest signals were several SNPs ( e. g., LEPR R109K, FABP2 A54T ) that had previously been associated with phenotypes directly related to cold tolerance. Since variation in climate may be correlated with other aspects of environmental variation, it is possible that some of the signals that we detected reflect selective pressures other than climate. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the idea that climate has been an important selective pressure acting on candidate genes for common metabolic disorders."

In particular, loss of Scrib leads to the induction of a signalling pathway that promotes cell proliferation and induces the development of atypical luminal cells. We also show that Scrib is required for the proper orientation of the mitotic spindle, which is critical for preventing apoptosis and has the potential to induce cell death.

However, the development of IVM resistance has resulted in significant economic losses in livestock, companion animals, and human populations. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the adaptation of IVM to IVM-resistant nematodes would help to develop new treatments that can increase the efficacy of IVM against resistant parasites. In this study, we have identified NHR-8, a nuclear hormone receptor involved in the xenobiotic response in Caenorhabditis elegans, as a new target of IVM resistance. Our results show that NHR-8 is involved in the development and function of the cellular detoxification network that contributes to IVM resistance in C. elegans. Importantly, NHR-8 was also shown to be involved in the development and function of the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus, which shares the major parasitic nematode of humans. We also provide evidence that Hco-nhr-8, a nuclear receptor previously shown to be involved in the response to anthelmintic macrocyclic lactones ( e. g., ivermectin ), is also involved in the development and function of the NHR-8-mediated IVM detoxification network in H. contortus.

Here, we have developed a model in which attenuation of BMP signaling sets the required intermediate levels to maintain neural crest induction. We show that the scaffold protein casein kinase interacting protein 1 ( CKIP-1 ) and ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 are coexpressed with BMP4 at the neural plate border. Knockdown of CKIP-1 during a critical period between gastrulation and neurulation causes neural crest loss. Consistent with specific BMP modulation, CKIP-1 loss suppresses phospho-Smads 1/5/8 ( pSmad1/5/8 ) and BMP reporter output, whereas overexpression of Smurf1 acts similarly. Epistasis experiments further show that CKIP-1 rescues Smurf1-mediated neural crest loss.

Neuropeptides are produced by dense core vesicles ( DCVs ), which are formed by a complex of clathrin-mediated membrane remodeling events. This maturation process is required for efficient processing of neuropeptides and removal of factors that would otherwise interfere with DCV release. We previously identified a GTPase, RAB-2, and its effector, RIC-19, that is required for DCV maturation in C. elegans motoneurons. In rab-2 mutants, specific cargo is lost from maturing DCVs and missorted into the endosomal/lysosomal degradation pathway. Cargo loss could be prevented by blocking endosomal delivery. This suggests that RAB-2 is involved in retention of DCV components during the sorting process at the Golgi-endosomal interface. To understand how RAB-2 activity is regulated at the Golgi, we identified a potential RAB-2 GAP, TBC-8, which is exclusively expressed in neurons and which, when depleted, shows similar defects as rab-2 mutants. We could demonstrate that RAB-2 binds to its putative GAP, TBC-8. Interestingly, TBC-8 also binds to the RAB-2 effector, RIC-19. This interaction appears to be conserved as TBC-8 also interacts with the human ortholog of RIC-19, ICA69.

Our results demonstrate that, in addition to the traditional methods of phylogenomics, we can obtain a global view of the evolution of plant genomes by studying the relationships among the 101 groups of orthologs. We have also used this approach to identify genes that are likely involved in the evolution of the plant kingdom. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the evolution of plant genomes, and also reveal the evolutionary relationships among the 101 groups of orthologs."

Typhi ), transmitted through contaminated food or water, and can cause severe symptoms, such as typhoid fever. The bacterium has been isolated from the intestine of people with typhoid fever who have been vaccinated against the protein in their blood, but some people have not been vaccinated. We conducted a survey of the blood of people in Fiji, an upper-middle income country in the Pacific Ocean, to measure the prevalence of antibodies to the protein in the blood of the people who had never been vaccinated against the protein in the past. The results show that people who have never been vaccinated against the protein are more likely to have been infected with the bacteria in the past, which suggests that exposure to the protein may be a cause of illness in those who did not receive vaccination. The presence of a pit latrine, a septic water, or a small town or village also increases the probability that people are exposed to the protein. Improving sanitation where pit latrines are used and addressing potential transmission routes in settlements may reduce exposure to the protein to S. Typhi."

In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the P-loop NTPase regulates the identity of the root apical meristem ( AM ) cell and the distal stem cell ( DSC ) niche. In this study, we found that the P-loop NTPase regulates ROS homeostasis in the apical meristem and the DSC niche in the root apical meristem. The P-loop NTPase-mediated ROS level is required for the regulation of cell division and the maintenance of the DSC niche in the apical meristem. Interestingly, the P-loop NTPase-regulated ROS level and the maintenance of the DSC niche are dependent on the level of protein SHORTROOT ( SHR ). These results indicate that the P-loop NTPase-regulated ROS signaling controls the identity of the root QC and the DSC niche."

Cells of the rod-shaped bacterium Myxococcus xanthus coordinate cell division with chromosome replication and segregation. This coordination is essential, but the molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. In this work, we have analyzed the arrangement of the circular chromosome ( a circular DNA molecule ) and the dynamics of its subcellular localization and replication. We show that, in newborn cells, the chromosome is arranged between two subpolar regions, each containing only one copy of the chromosome, and each separated from the nearest subpolar region by approximately 1 \u00b5m. The bulk of the chromosome is arranged between the two subpolar regions, thus leaving the two large subpolar regions devoid of DNA. Upon replication, one subpolar region remains in the original subpolar region while the other copy segregates unidirectionally to the opposite subpolar region. In parallel, the ter region of the mother chromosome relocates to midcell, where it is replicated. Consequently, after completion of replication and segregation, the two chromosomes show an arrangement that combines features from previously described systems with new features leading to a novel spatiotemporal arrangement pattern."

This process is called DNA transfer, and it is important to study how bacteria evolve to become able to actively transfer DNA. Some bacteria employ a mechanism to take up DNA and incorporate it into their genome, a process called transformation. The donor cell actively pushes out DNA and the recipient cell employs the natural competence system to take up the DNA, in a process called conjugation. While the DNA uptake machinery is well known as in other species that undergo transformation, the pushing step of conjugation remains to be characterized. We have found that the TdtA protein, which is involved in DNA uptake, is also required for DNA pushing but not for DNA pulling. Purified TdtA shows ATPase activity and oligomerizes as hexamers with a central opening that can accommodate double-stranded DNA. The tdtA gene was found to belong to a mobile 14 kbp-long DNA element inserted within the 3\u2032 end of a tRNA gene, flanked by 47 bp direct repeats. The insertion also encoded a type II restriction endonuclease and a NurA-like nuclease, whose activities were required for efficient transjugation. All these data support that TdtA belongs to a new type of Integrative and Conjugative Element which promotes the generalized and efficient transfer of genetic traits that could facilitate its co-selection among bacterial populations."

Some biological functions peaked soon after a brief territorial challenge and then declined, while others peaked hours afterwards. We identify transcription factors that are predicted to coordinate waves of transcription associated with different components of behavioral plasticity. We also show that a brief territorial intrusion was sufficient to rapidly and dramatically alter the epigenome, and that changes in gene expression also accompany changes in chromatin accessibility. Finally, we integrate time course brain gene expression data with a transcriptional regulatory network and link gene expression to changes in chromatin accessibility.

For a long time, evolutionary biologists have used a simple mutation rate to estimate evolutionary times, assuming that the mutation rate is constant across species. Now, with new genomic sequencing technologies, it is possible to directly measure the mutation rate of a DNA region, the mitochondrial genome of Drosophila melanogaster. We compared the mutation rate of the mitochondrial genome in D. melanogaster lines that had undergone about 200 generations of spontaneous mutation accumulation. We estimate the mutation rate of the mitochondrial genome to be about 6. 2\u00d710\u22128 per site per fly generation, which is 30 times higher than the nuclear mutation rate. The mitochondrial mutation rate per base pair per fly generation is about 10\u00d7 higher than the nuclear rate, but the mutation rate per base pair per fly generation is about 70\u00d7 higher than the nuclear rate. These findings suggest that, besides being a useful way to infer evolutionary times, mitochondrial DNA mutation rates are also useful for understanding the extreme mutation bias towards A+T and silent sites."

Binding of P. falciparum infected red blood cells ( RBCs ) to gC1qR is a key event in the pathogenesis of severe malaria, and is associated with high levels of parasitemia and organ damage. Here, we analyzed the cytoadhesion of P. falciparum infected RBCs to gC1qR from Mozambican children with severe malaria and uncomplicated malaria, as well as a P. falciparum 3D7 ( Pf3D7 ) selected for binding to gC1qR. We show that Pf3D7gC1qR overexpressed DC8, a cytoadhesion molecule type, mediates binding to gC1qR through a conserved surface domain in DBL\u03b212. Our results also show that the parasite ligand used in this study, PFD0020c, can inhibit binding to gC1qR of Pf3D7gC1qR and four P. falciparum isolates by 50%. These findings are important for understanding the interaction between gC1qR and P. falciparum infected RBCs and for designing interventions against severe malaria caused by this specific binding."

Small mammals were live-trapped at various locations across Mali for the purpose of identifying potential zoonotic pathogens. Serological and molecular assays were employed and determined LASV infected rodents were exclusively found in the southern Mali near the border of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Overall, 19. 4% of Mastomys natalensis sampled in this region had evidence of LASV infection, with prevalence rates for individual villages ranging from 0 to 52%. Full-length genomic sequences were determined using high throughput sequencing methodologies for LASV isolates generated from tissue samples of rodents collected in four villages and confirmed the phylogenetic clustering of Malian LASV with strain AV. The risk of human infections with LASV is greatest in villages in southern Mali. Lassa fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis for febrile individuals and appropriate diagnostic techniques need to be established to determine the incidence of infection and disease in these regions."

Red blood cells must deform to squeeze through these narrow vessels, transiently blocking or occluding the vessels they pass through. Although the dynamics of vessel occlusion have been studied extensively, it remains an open question why microvessels need to be so narrow. We show that pressure feedbacks created when red blood cells enter the finest vessels of the trunk network act together to uniformly partition red blood cells through the microvasculature. Using mathematical models as well as direct observation, we show that these occlusive feedbacks are tuned throughout the trunk network to prevent the vessels closest to the heart from short-circuiting the network. Thus occlusion is linked with another open question of microvascular function: how are red blood cells delivered at the same rate to each micro-vessel? Our analysis shows that tuning of occlusive feedbacks increase the total dissipation within the network by a factor of 11, showing that uniformity of flows rather than minimization of transport costs may be prioritized by the microvascular network."

Y. pestis is present in fleas, rodent and flea hosts, but it is unknown whether it can survive in humans. To test if it can survive in humans, we used a rodent nonhuman primate model of bubonic plague, a disease that kills 20, 000 people each year. We used a bactericidal drug, called valine, and a nonhuman primate route to treat infection. We found that this bactericidal drug was effective at killing the bacteria in both rodent and flea hosts, and that it was effective in curing infection in animals that had been infected with Y. pestis. We also found that the bactericidal drug could be used to treat other forms of plague, which have a similar bactericidal effect.

We demonstrate that the cohesinopathy mutations eco1-W216G and smc1-Q843\u0394 are associated with defects in ribosome biogenesis and a reduction in the actively translating fraction of ribosomes, e. g., the 35S-methionine incorporation, which indicates a deficit in protein translation. The production of ribosomal RNA from an individual repeat is reduced while copy number remains unchanged. Our data suggest that cohesin proteins normally facilitate production of ribosomal RNA and protein translation, and this is one way they can influence gene expression.

To account for this effect, we developed a computational model that incorporates the molecular crowding as a factor in the diffusion process. We show that the diffusion constant is strongly regulated by the cytoplasmic concentration of calcium, and by the cytoplasmic spines and the synaptic inputs. We show that for moderate cytoplasmic concentration of calcium, the diffusion constant is mainly regulated by the cytoplasmic concentration, and not by the cytoplasmic ion gradients.

We used precise methods of enumeration and in vivo labeling with 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine to track recently divided pDC in blood and tissue compartments of monkeys with acute pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) infection. We show that pDC are lost from blood and peripheral lymph nodes within 14 days of infection, despite a normal frequency of pDC in bone marrow. Paradoxically, pDC loss masked a highly dynamic response characterized by rapid pDC mobilization into blood and a 10- to 20-fold increase in recruitment to lymph nodes relative to uninfected animals. Within lymph nodes, pDC had increased levels of apoptosis and necrosis, were uniformly activated, and were infected at frequencies similar to CD4+ T cells. Nevertheless, remaining pDC had essentially normal functional responses to stimulation through Toll-like receptor 7, with half of lymph node pDC producing both TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1. These findings reveal that rapid recruitment of pDC to inflamed lymph nodes in lentivirus infection has a pathologic consequence, bringing cells into close contact with virus, virus-infected cells, and pro-apoptotic factors leading to pDC death."

Here, we show that current methods to quantify risk of transmission for these three routes are either under- or over-estimate the risk of transmission. Our results suggest that current methods do not accurately estimate the risk of transmission for sexual or other transmission routes.

In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to describe the mechanisms by which latently infected cells can reemerge and persist in the face of therapy. We show that the low-level persistent viremia can be induced in a variety of ways, and that the virus can escape elimination by periodic drug administration.

Finally, we develop a simple model that can reproduce the multifaceted responses observed in clinical studies and make them consistent with the latent reservoirs' persistence in the face of therapy.

During septum formation, cells regulate the activity of genes controlling cell division and cell polarity. Eukaryotic cells contain three different signaling pathways that are coordinately regulated during septum formation. In fungi, these pathways are represented by two major groups of regulators: the septation initiation ( SIN ) and the morphogenesis ( MOR ). In mammals, these two pathways are connected by a signaling node that is regulated by the germinal centre kinase ( GC ). Here, we identify a third GC kinase, MST-1, which is involved in the cross-regulation between these two pathways. Genetic and biochemical data show that MST-1 is involved in the control of the SIN pathway, which is known to be important for the regulation of cell division and polarity. In addition, the data show that MST-1 is involved in the regulation of the MOR pathway, which is known to be important for the control of the septum. In addition, we show that MST-1 is required for the proper formation of the actomyosin rings that are required for proper constriction of the septum. Finally, we show that MST-1 is also involved in the regulation of the MOR pathway. These results suggest that the two pathways are coordinately regulated by diverse signaling molecules, which may be relevant to the cross-regulation between the two pathways in eukaryotes."

By removing 36 putative Zelda binding sites unexpectedly present in the original reporter, we show that the 750 bp of the Bicoid promoter are sufficient to recapitulate endogenous expression at the onset of zygotic transcription. While the time period required to reach the plateau is proportional to the distance to the anterior pole, we show that it only takes 3 minutes at each interphase for the MS2 reporter loci to distinguish subtle differences in Bicoid concentration and establish a steep ( Hill coefficient ~ 7 ) expression boundary. Our results suggest that a simple model based only on the cooperative binding of Bicoid is not sufficient to describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of early hb expression."

The Nif is a crucial organ for birdsong production, and the organ also provides the main input to the motor output system that drives our vocal production. We show that the Nif output is delayed relative to the response in the auditory cortex. This delay is correlated with the time delay between successive syllables: syllables that are spoken by a single syllable before one syllable can be understood are preceded by a similar delay. Our results suggest that the Nif output is delayed relative to the response in the auditory cortex, and this delay is correlated with its sensory consequences."

PEV is caused by the insertion of a transgene into heterochromatic sequences. A similar phenomenon is observed in fission yeast. We have identified an exceptional position at which the PEV element is associated with silencing of its own transcriptional element. However, after it is segregated away, element activity is restored. This restoration is accompanied by a reversal of DNA methylation. To our knowledge, this is the first documented example of a position effect that is associated with the reversal of epigenetic silencing. This observation suggests that there are cis-acting sequences that alter the propensity of an epigenetically silenced gene to remain inactive. This raises the interesting possibility that an important feature of local chromatin environments may be the capacity to erase previously established epigenetic marks."

In this study, we examined the function of Vvl in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum ( Tenebrionidae ). Knockdown of vvl expression delayed the onset of metamorphosis and inhibition of larval growth, indicating that Vvl acts upstream of JH signaling. Accordingly, ecdysone titer and the expression of ecdysone response gene were reduced in vvl knockdown larvae. The expression of the ecdysone biosynthesis gene phantom ( phm ) and spook ( spo ) were reduced in vvl knockdown larvae in the anterior and posterior halves, respectively. Injection of 20-hydroxyecdysone ( 20E ) into vvl knockdown larvae could restore the expression of HR3, the ecdysone response gene. Our findings suggest that Vvl coordinates both JH and ecdysteroids as well as molting behavior to influence molting and the timing of metamorphosis.

Then, they process the heme iron, which is returned to the circulation for reutilization by red blood cell precursors during erythropoiesis. Iron release from macrophages depends on the level of iron present in the cell as a positive feedback mechanism. A currently accepted model of iron release assumes a passive-gradient with free diffusion of iron ( Fe2+ ) through ferroportin ( FPN ), the transporter on the plasma membrane. Outside the cell, a multi-copper ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin ( Cp ) oxidizes ferrous to ferric ion. According to the passive-gradient model, the removal of ferrous ion from the site of release sustains the gradient that maintains the iron release. Subcellular localization of FPN may be more complex. We have investigated the detailed mechanism of iron release from macrophages focusing on the roles of the Cp, FPN and apo-Tf. The facilitated-transport model is quantitatively analyzed using a mathematical model for the first time. A comparison of experimental data with model simulations shows that the passive-gradient model cannot explain macrophage iron release. However, a facilitated-transport model associated with FPN can explain the iron release mechanism. According to the facilitated-transport model, intracellular FPN carries labile iron to the macrophage membrane. Extracellular Cp accelerates the oxidation of ferrous ion bound to FPN. Facilitated-transport model can correctly predict cellular iron efflux and is essential for physiologically relevant whole-body iron metabolism."

Here, we dissect the mechanisms by which TNF\u03b1 promotes cell motility and invasiveness of parasitized host cells. We show that TNF\u03b1 promotes the formation of polar, F-actin-rich invasion structures by targeting expression and function of the host ser/thr kinase MAP4K4. MAP4K4 is activated by TNF\u03b1 and MAP4K4 expression is also induced by TNF\u03b1 signaling and MAP4K4 expression in infected cells.

MAP4K4 expression is induced by TNF\u03b1 signaling and MAP4K4 expression is also induced by MAP4K4 signaling. MAP4K4 is inhibited by the host anti-inflammatory signaling MAP4K4E and MAP4K4R and the effects are parasite dependent.

While numerous genetic variants that influence human metabolism have been identified, few are known to influence human metabolism in a specific organ, such as the blood. Here, we have taken advantage of recent technical and methodological advances to examine the genetics of human metabolism. We have examined over 4, 000 people from three different ethnic groups, and have identified a number of genetic variants that affect blood metabolism. We then replicated the same variants in large numbers of people of different ethnic backgrounds to identify which genetic variants are specific to blood. Our results suggest that these genetic variants affect specific biological processes that regulate blood homeostasis. We also show that some of these variants are associated with chronic disease, such as hypertension or ischemic stroke, but that other disease risk variants have not previously been associated with these biological processes. Our study is the largest to date to examine the genetic influence on human metabolism. We believe that this large number of variants will provide novel insight into the etiology of disease."

We analyzed genome-wide gene expression levels in the brain of three pairs of domesticated and wild animals. We compared the expression differences with those between domesticated guinea pigs and a distant wild relative as well as between two lines of rats selected for tameness or aggression towards humans. We found that, although there were fewer gene expression differences between domesticated and wild animals, the genes with the most significant changes in expression between the different domestication events differed only for a small number of genes. There was almost no overlap between gene expression in domesticated and the tame and aggressive rats. However, two of the genes with the strongest expression changes between the rats ( DLL3 and DHDH ) were located in a genomic region associated with tameness and aggression. In summary, the majority of brain gene expression changes in domesticated animals are specific to the given domestication event, suggesting that the causative variants of behavioral domestication traits may also be different."

NAD ( P ) H autofluorescence was detected inside the chlamydial inclusion and showed enhanced signal intensity on the inclusion membrane as demonstrated by the co-localization with the 14-3-3\u03b2 host cell protein. An increase of the fluorescence lifetime of protein-bound NAD ( P ) H [\u03c42-NAD ( P ) H] inside the chlamydial inclusion strongly correlated with enhanced metabolic activity of chlamydial reticulate bodies during the mid-phase of infection. Inhibition of host cell metabolism that resulted in aberrant intracellular chlamydial inclusion morphology completely abrogated the \u03c42-NAD ( P ) H increase inside the chlamydial inclusion. Furthermore, a significant increase in \u03c42-NAD ( P ) H and a decrease in the relative amount of free NAD ( P ) H inside the host cell nucleus indicated cellular starvation during intracellular chlamydial infection.

This protein is essential for DNA repair and therefore mutations in XPF can result in a variety of human diseases. We have previously shown that a progeria-causing mutation ( XPFR153P ) in XPF can result in a similar phenotype in vitro and in vivo, and that this mutation results in mislocalization of XPF-ERCC1 in cells. Here we show that mislocalization of XPF-ERCC1 in cells from an XFE progeroid patient can partially reverse the phenotype of the mutation, suggesting that this mislocalization may be a factor that underlies the diverse symptoms associated with mutations in XPF. We also show that mislocalization of XPF-ERCC1 can be reconstituted in cells lacking XPF by injection of the mutant protein.

To better understand the mechanism of Zfp423 action, we generated a series of mice lacking Zfp423 specifically in the brain, and studied the effects of its loss on embryonic development. We found that Zfp423 is required for proper function of the primary cilium, a structure that is present in most cell types, and that loss of Zfp423 leads to defects in the primary cilia, the projections of cells that transmit signals between cells. This defect can be suppressed by overexpression of the gene Tulp3, which encodes a component of the primary cilium. We also found that loss of Zfp423 causes mislocalization of Smoothened, a gene that is important for normal development. These results suggest that loss of Zfp423 causes mislocalization of Smoothened and a loss of Tulp3, which is a critical component of the primary cilium.

We present data on the consequences of interrupted feeding and the role of the neural circuitry. The model suggests that this mechanism could be used by the nervous system to control behavioral data that are not directly controlled. We show that the model is fit to experimental data on rats eating in meals and that its elements can be identified with neurophysiological processes. We then show that the model can also account for behavioral data on eating in multiple phases.

The precise mechanism by which IKKs gain the ability to induce NF-\u03baB transcription is poorly understood. Here, we report a 4 \u00c5 x-ray crystal structure of human IKK2 ( hIKK2 ) in its catalytically active conformation. We demonstrate that, like in the case of Xenopus IKK2 ( xIKK2 ), hIKK2 adopts an open conformation that permits high oligomerization within the crystal. We also identify two surfaces that mediate oligomerization, which are critical for the process of hIKK2 activation. We propose that IKK2 dimers transiently associate with one another through these interaction surfaces to promote trans auto-phosphorylation as part of their mechanism of activation. This study supports recent structural data that implicate strand exchange as part of a mechanism for IKK2 activation via trans auto-phosphorylation. Moreover, oligomerization through the interfaces identified in this study and subsequent trans auto-phosphorylation account for the rapid amplification of IKK2 phosphorylation observed even in the absence of any upstream kinase."

Here, we describe a new role for the chemokine receptor Ccr1 in promoting neutrophil accumulation in the kidney and increasing renal function in mouse models of invasive candidiasis. Consistent with this, neutrophils from wild-type mice in blood and kidney switched from Ccr1lo to Ccr1high at late time-points post-infection, when Ccr1 ligands were produced in the kidney and were chemotactic for kidney neutrophils ex vivo. When a 1\u22361 mixture of Ccr1+/+ and Ccr1\u2212/\u2212 donor neutrophils was adoptively transferred intravenously into Ccr1+/+ recipient mice, neutrophil trafficking into the kidney was significantly skewed toward Ccr1+/+ cells.

In this work, we have used a novel microstructural modeling approach to compare the mechanical properties of Fn fibers with those of other types of ECM fibers. We have found that this approach is able to predict the mechanical properties of Fn fibers with a level of detail not possible with single molecule measurements. Comparing the properties predicted by single molecule measurements to in vitro measurements of Fn fibers allowed us to show that the ability of Fn fibers to stretch to a high extension is largely determined by their inherent conformational properties.

Using a computational technique designed to predict structural perturbations in chimaeric proteins, we demonstrate that observed recombination events tend to be less disruptive than sets of simulated ones.

We also demonstrated that the Drosophila apoB-lipoproteins, but not the mtp, in the cardiomyocytes, are responsible for systemic TG reduction on high fat diet, likely by increasing the expression of apoLpp. Our findings reveal a novel and significant function of heart-mediated apoB-lipoproteins in controlling lipid homeostasis."

Recql4 mutations are associated with several benign skeletal abnormalities, such as Rothmund-Thmun syndrome ( RTS ) and RAPADILINO syndrome ( RAPADILINO syndrome ). The function of RECQL4 in normal adult bone development is largely uncharacterised. We have therefore investigated the role of Recql4 in bone development using mouse models. In the case of RTS, we have found Recql4 is required for normal bone development and normal bone formation. In contrast, in the case of RAPADILINO syndrome, we have found Recql4 is required for normal osteoblast function and bone formation. However, we have found that the Recql4 deletion in the bone-forming cells did not cause a detectable phenotype. Further, the Recql4 deletion in bone-forming cells did not cause a detectable phenotype in the bone-forming cells, but did cause a significant increase in the length of the survival of mice. Our data therefore provide a mechanism for the benign skeletal phenotypes of RECQL4 mutation syndromes. We propose that tumor suppression and osteosarcoma susceptibility are most likely a function of mutant, not null, alleles of RECQL4."

One important component of the theory is the assumption that individuals have value systems that are distinct from each other and that they should be treated as separate entities. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model of \u2018game theory of Mind\u2019 and show how to use it to infer the sophistication of each other's value system. We show how to quantify this sophistication and show how the sophistication is related to the amount of effort each other is ready to contribute to.

They are involved in the control of many physiological processes, including development and function of the nervous system. In the Central Nervous System, Wnt1 is a key developmental regulator that directs proliferation, survival, and neurogenesis. Wnt1 is expressed from the midbrain, and its function depends on a transcription factor called Lmx1b. Here, we show that the expression of Lmx1b and a newly characterized microRNA, miR135a2, are regulated by Wnt1. Loss of Lmx1b results in severe alterations in Wnt1/Wnt signaling and expansion of the dopamine progenitor domain, while loss of miR135a2 does not have a similar effect. Loss of miR135a2 results in a significant reduction in Wnt1/Wnt signaling in the midbrain, and a reduction in the size of the dopamine progenitor domain. These findings suggest that the microRNA-mediated control of Wnt1/Wnt signaling could have important implications for the design of microRNA-based strategies to control Wnt signaling."

CBS could be taken as indication that there is a generative model in the brain, specifically one that can synthesise rich, consistent visual representations even in the absence of actual visual input. Here, we argue that a neural network model based on a recent artificial neural network ( deep Boltzmann machine [DBM] ) can capture the relevant aspects of ( hypothetical ) generative processing in the cortex. We show that homeostatic plasticity could serve to make the learnt internal model robust against e. g. degradation of sensory input, but overcompensate in the case of CBS, leading to hallucinations.

Fifteen genes were selected based on possible relevance to NCC, and analyzed by qPCR. qPCR analysis of 15 selected genes showed generally higher gene expression among NCC patients, followed by RNCC, idiopathic headaches and single cyst granulomas.

To gain insight into clock output functions of REV-ERB\u03b1, we carried out genome-wide gene expression profiling experiments with liver RNA from wild-type mice, Rev- erb\u03b1 knock-out mice, or REV-ERB\u03b1 overexpressing mice.

Several issues regarding the evaluation data sets may however have led to the performance values being underestimated: all potential epitopes have been mapped on an antigen, and antibodies are generally raised against the antigen in a given biological context not against the antigen monomer. Improper dealing with these aspects leads to many artificial false positive predictions and hence to incorrect low performance values.

We have identified the PIGMENTASE2-TYPING-GYF DOMAIN-CONTaining PROTEIN 1 ( PSIG1 ), which is involved in the regulation of the cell death response. Our results show that PSIG1 helps to restrict cell death induction during plant-pathogen interaction. Inactivation of PSIG1 does not result in spontaneous lesions, and enhanced cell death in psig1 mutants is independent of salicylic acid ( SA ) biosynthesis or reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production. Moreover, PSIG1 interacts with SMG7, which plays a role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ), and the smg7-4 mutant allele mimics the cell death phenotype of the psig1 mutants.

Our analysis also suggests that in general, the translation velocity of ribosomes is slower at the beginning of the coding sequence and tends to increase downstream. Finally, a comparison of these data to the expected biophysical behavior of translation suggests that it suffers from some unknown biases. Specifically, the ribosomal flux measured on the experimental data increases along the coding sequence; however, according to any biophysical model of ribosomal movement lacking internal initiation sites, the flux is expected to remain constant or decrease.

Our algorithm is based on analysis of all three clinical and laboratory data to predict disease severity in an automated way. We have shown that our algorithm can be used differently in different disease prevalence to yield clinically useful positive and negative predictive values. Furthermore, we have shown that our algorithm is associated with haemorrhage and shock in adults with dengue fever. This study provides a proof-of-concept that computational algorithms using simple clinical and haematological parameters can predict diagnosis and prognosis of dengue disease."

This is particularly important for insects, as their lifespan is highly variable across species. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the activity of FoxO ( dFOXO ), a forkhead box transcription factor ( TF ) family member, regulates lifespan determination. FoxO controls a number of other TFs, but how these TFs in turn might mediate the anti-ageing programmes orchestrated by FoxOs in vivo is unclear. Here, we identify a novel dFOXO target, the E-twenty six ( ETS ) -family transcription factor ( AOP ), as regulated by the single Drosophila FoxO ( dFOXO ). AOP, the functional orthologue of the human Etv6/Tel protein, binds numerous genomic sites also occupied by dFOXO and counteracts the activity of an ETS activator, PNT, to prevent the lifespan-shortening effects of co-activation of dFOXO and PNT. This detrimental synergistic effect of dFOXO and PNT appears to stem from a mis-regulation of lipid metabolism. At the same time, AOP activity in another fly organ, the fat body, has further beneficial roles, regulating genes in common with dfoxo, such as the secreted, non-sensory, odorant binding protein ( Obp99b ), and robustly extending lifespan. Our study reveals a complex interplay between evolutionarily conserved ETS factors and dFOXO, the functional significance of which may extend well beyond animal lifespan."

This strategy, however, is not a cure and may be problematic if the parasite has developed the ability to evade immune effectors and/or survive for many years. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop vaccines against these parasites. Here we have developed a strategy for DNA vaccination against filarial nematodes that targets parasite-induced immunosuppression while concurrently enhancing Th2 immune responses and parasite antigen presentation by dendritic cells. Our results show that DNA vaccination against filarial nematodes, which are highly prevalent in the developing world, can be used to enhance Th2 immune responses and also protect against microfilariae."

Among paralogs, those found within the same species are consistently more functionally similar than those found in a different species. We also find that paralogous pairs residing on the same chromosome are more functionally similar than those on different chromosomes, perhaps due to higher levels of interlocus gene conversion between these pairs.

To provide a predictive framework to examine enamel distribution, we develop a computational model of enamel matrix secretion that maps the dentine topography to the enamel surface topography. Starting from empirical enamel-dentine junctions that have markedly different dentine and enamel surface topologies, we show how diffusion-limited free boundary mechanisms account for both the process of matrix secretion and the final enamel distribution. Simulations reveal how concave and convex dentine features have distinct effects on the final enamel surface, thereby explaining why the enamel surface is not a straightforward extrapolation of the dentine template.

The transmission cycle requires freshwater snails, and the transmission is facilitated by the development of snails in the liver and the bladder. The eggs of the snails are released into the environment, and the larvae in the snails are ready for transmission. The transmission is initiated in the human host when the snails ingest the S. mansoni eggs, which then develop into larvae in the liver. The snails release the larvae into the environment, and the adult worms develop in the liver. In the first few years of infection, the snails produce a small number of eggs, which are released into the environment. The snails, therefore, can be observed in the snails' tissues, but the results are often difficult to interpret. The current method, the Kato-Katz technique, has low sensitivity for very light infections, and sensitivity for the presence of large numbers of eggs in the snail is very low. The widespread use of the Kato-Katz technique to map schistosomiasis prevalence is a major health care concern, and it is recommended for mapping, control, and surveillance programs.

We show that in the presence of protective antibodies, there is enhanced cellular infiltration in the gut wall. Intra-vital imaging of infected intestinal tissue revealed a four-fold increase in the infiltration of immune cells. Mice deficient in complement component or FcR\u03b3-mediated effector cell infiltration, or IL-4/IL-25-dependent inflammatory monocytes, remain fully immune. Our data provide the first evidence that vaccine-induced immunity to intestinal helminths involves IgG1 antibodies that are induced by antigens secreted in concert with IL-25-dependent myeloid effector populations."

This process is facilitated by a process termed \u201cpore formation\u201d, which requires a high curvature of the fusion pore rim to expose the hydrophobic interior of the membrane to water. How proteins breach this thermodynamic barrier to pore formation is unclear. Here, we identified a novel lipid packing sensor ( FLiPS ) in the cytosolic domain of the FAST protein, which is essential for pore formation during cell-cell fusion and syncytiogenesis. The p15 FLiPS preferentially partitions into membranes with high positive curvature, and is impaired by a small molecule that inserts into hydrophobic defects in membranes. Most notably, the p15 FLiPS can be functionally replaced by heterologous amphipathic lipid packing sensors ( ALPS ), but not by other membrane-interactive amphipathic helices. Furthermore, a previously unrecognized amphipathic helix in the cytosolic domain of the reptilian reovirus p14 FAST protein can functionally replace the p15 FLiPS, and is itself replaceable by a heterologous ALPS motif. Anchored near the cytoplasmic leaflet by the FAST protein transmembrane domain, the FLiPS is perfectly positioned to insert into hydrophobic defects that begin to appear in the highly curved rim of nascent fusion pores, thereby lowering the energy barrier to stable pore formation."

Treatment for infection is limited to 1\u20132 drugs and vector control is the only method to prevent transmission. Treatment can be difficult to diagnose in the chronic infection because the parasite can live for many years in the body. In the chronic stage of infection, children are often missed as they may be infected prior to treatment. We conducted a serological survey in children living in an area of Peru with T. cruzi transmission. We used a novel method to collect information about the infection status of children in order to determine which children are most likely to be infected. Our results show that more than 83% of infected children could be identified while testing only 22% of eligible children.

This isomer is not formed by the normal route and is not required for Tva-induced activation of Env, including pre-hairpin association with membranes and low pH assembly of helical bundles.

During infection, the metabolic pathways of L. pneumophila are rapidly reprogrammed to support replication and host survival. In this study, we found that the metabolic reprogramming of the LCV is controlled by the transcription factor MTOR. During infection, the metabolic reprogramming of the LCV is dampened by the Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) adaptor protein Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 ( Myd88 ), which dampens MTOR signaling. In the absence of MTOR, LCV expansion and the host cell death response are enhanced. In addition, we show that L. pneumophila has evolved to reprogram the intracellular lipid metabolism for optimal replication and host survival. Our findings provide new insights into how L. pneumophila replicates inside a host membrane-bound compartment."

A cure is still elusive, but several attempts have been unsuccessful. To be successful, a vaccine must combine elements of the host immune response and the ability of the pathogen to evade the immune system. The latter is particularly important in prion diseases, since the main difficulty is to overcome the tolerance of the host immune system to the prion protein, which is not very toxic. Unfortunately, passive antibody therapy has proven effective only during early, asymptomatic disease, before the onset of symptoms. Therefore, it is crucial to understand precisely how the immune system may overcome prion problems and which effector pathways may delay disease progression. We have developed a transgenic mouse that expresses the same receptor as the human immunodeficiency virus type I, but with only one of the two receptor chains. We show that the transgenic mice are eliminated during ontogeny, but then proliferate more extensively in a prion-infected host. We also show that, even though the immune response can be suppressed by this TCR-mediated cell-mediated pathway, partial protection may be achieved through a cell-mediated pathway involving IL-4 production. These findings support the idea that cell-mediated immunity in neurodegenerative conditions may not be necessarily detrimental and may even contribute, when properly controlled, to the resolution of pathological processes."

Spastin is a conserved microtubule ( MT ) -severing protein, involved in processes requiring rearrangement of the cytoskeleton in concert to membrane remodeling, such as neurite branching, axonal growth, mid-body abscission, and endosome tubulation. Here, we show that spastin can sort from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to lipid droplets ( LDs ). Mutation of arginine 65 to glycine abolishes LD targeting. Increased expression of spastin reduced the number of LDs, while overexpression of Dspastin increased LD number. Downregulation of Dspastin and expression of a dominant-negative variant decreased LD number in Drosophila nerves, skeletal muscle and fat bodies, and reduced triacylglycerol levels. Moreover, we found reduced amount of fat stores in intestinal cells of worms in which the spas-1 homologue was either depleted by RNA interference or deleted. Taken together, our data uncovers an evolutionarily conserved role of spastin as a positive regulator of LD metabolism and open up the possibility that dysfunction of LDs in axons may contribute to the pathogenesis of HSP."

We found that the rate limiting steps are not equal, with temperature affecting the rate of transcription initiation in the Plac/ara-1 promoter and in the PtetA promoter. Our analysis also revealed that the rate limiting step configuration is influenced by temperature, such that the rate of transcription initiation is either insensitive or reciprocally regulated by changes in the other steps. We then used the derived models to explore a possible cause for why the identified steps are preferred as the main cause for behavior modifications with temperature: we find that transcription dynamics is either insensitive or responds reciprocally to changes in the other steps. Our results suggests that different promoters employ different rate limiting step patterns that control not only their rate and variability, but also their sensitivity to environmental changes."

Additionally, we show that the DnaK L484W variant exhibits chaperone-substrate interactions that are similar to those observed in wild-type proteins. Our computational analysis fits well with previous yeast genetics studies regarding the functionality of the Ssa1-21 protein and provides further evidence suggesting that modulation of the Hsp70 ATPase cycle to favor the ADP/substrate-bound form impairs prion propagation.

We have monitored the rate of transcription of the Spo0A gene during growth in sporulation medium using promoter fusions to firefly luciferase. This rate increases sharply during transient diauxie-like pauses in growth rate and then declines as growth resumes. The growth pause-dependent bursts of Spo0A transcription reflect the activity of the Spo0A vegetative promoter, and we propose that they represent initial responses to stress that bring the average cell closer to the thresholds for transition to bimodally expressed developmental responses. Measurement of the numbers of cells expressing a competence marker before and after the bursts supports this hypothesis. Our data contradicts the hypothesis that sporulation is initiated when a ppGpp-induced decline in GTP pool relieves repression by CodY. We suggest that, while the programmed induction of sporulation that occurs in stationary phase is apparently provoked by increased flux through the phosphorelay, bet-hedging stochastic transitions to at least competence are induced by bursts in transcription."

To make these cells, mesoderm cells must divide and then differentiate into a specific cell type, which is achieved by controlling the expression of a small number of genes, which are then activated by transcription factors in a complex manner. It is not known how these genes are activated, or what role the transcription factors play in activating these genes. We used a cell-based system to study the role of the transcription factor Pax3 in activating a subset of genes in mesoderm cells. We identified that Pax3 activates skeletal myogenic commitment factors and that it does this by controlling the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. Our work provides the first analysis of how Pax3 functions, and the first evidence that this function involves remodulating DNA accessibility."

This effect is independent of RXR-mediated activation of the innate immune system. Moreover, RXRs specifically mediate survival of dermal fibroblasts in a \u201cnon-cell autonomous\u201d manner, without altering the growth and survival of neighboring cells. Our results identify RXRs as novel mediators of immune surveillance in mice, and suggest that RXRs may represent novel therapeutic targets against UV-induced skin cancer."

In particular, microdomains are involved in clustered synaptic plasticity and efficient information transfer. Dendritic voltage-gated ion channels are known to be important for microdomain propagation, but it is not known if these channels regulate the spatiotemporal spread of microdomains. We employed a multiscale, morphologically realistic, conductance-based model of the hippocampal pyramidal neuron that accounted for experimental details of calcium-dependent signaling. We activated N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptors through threshold-burst stimulation ( TBS ) or pairing ( TBP ), and assessed microdomain propagation along a signaling pathway that included calmodulin, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) and protein phosphatase 1. We found that the spatiotemporal spread of the TBS-evoked microdomain in phosphorylated CaMKII was amplified by CaMKII. Next, we assessed the role of two dendritically expressed inactivating channels, one that suppressed the spread of pCaMKII microdomains by inhibiting the calcium influx without changing the voltage response to TBS, and another that enhanced this spread by modulating TBS-induced calcium influx without changing the voltage. Our results reveal that CaMKII amplification or suppression depends critically on dendritic voltage-gated ion channels and on the biochemical properties of microdomains. Our conclusions therefore have important implications for several synaptic plasticity and information transfer mechanisms."

This inhibition prevents ubiquitination and degradation of the NF-\u03baB\u03b1 subunit, which is a key factor for initiating an immune response against pathogens.

In this study, we investigated the functional principles underlying the communication between the OB and the lateral entorhinal cortex ( LEC ) during the development of the mouse. Our results show that the mature maturation of the OB\u2013LEC circuit depends on the presence of highly synchronous and prolonged electrical activity. Interestingly, the activity of the OB is gated by a special type of neurons in the LEC. This novel activity is dependent on the presence of a threshold concentration of odor molecules in the LEC, and the absence of odor is sufficient to elicit electrical activity in the OB. Chronic impairment of the maturation of the OB results in a loss of this electrical activity and leads to impaired odor detection. Our results highlight the importance of the maturation of the OB\u2013LEC circuit and provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of odor detection by the mouse olfactory bulb."

This activation is accompanied by upregulation of the transcription factor KLF4. In this work, we report that the microRNA-26a ( miR-26a ) and its target KLF4 are involved in regulation of macrophages inflammatory cytokine production. We show that both downregulation of miR-26a and upregulation of KLF4 facilitate upregulation of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and thus promotes the activation of host signaling pathways. Furthermore, we show that the CREB-C/EBP\u03b2 signaling axis also favors M2 polarization.

Until now, there is no vaccine available to prevent the infection. This work aimed at the evaluation of a new family of Leishmania antigenic proteins, the LiPABP proteins. Three members of this family have been described. Recombinant proteins were used for the coating of ELISA plates. The results obtained show that the three LiPABP proteins induce a Th1-like response and confer partial protection against Leishmania major infection in a mouse model. This partial protection was able to down-regulate the IL-10 mediated responses elicited by the three LiPABP proteins after infection in this mouse model. This modulation induced a partial protection against L. major infection. This partial protection was also accompanied by a decrease in parasite burdens, in antibody titers against Leishmania antigens and in the IL-4 and IL-10 parasite-specific mediated responses in comparison to control mice groups."

Here, we used genetic epistasis analyses to identify additional components of this pathway by screening for genes that encode developmentally co-expressed candidate matriptase targets, and found that prostasin, the GPI-anchored serine protease, is critical for the activity of matriptase. Furthermore, we generated mice lacking the c-Met, PAR-2, and ENaC subunits, which were previously shown to be critical for matriptase activation, and found that matriptase activity is not required for the development of placental tissues. Our results suggest that the protease may not be critical for focal proteolytic activation of PAR-2 during neural tube closure.

We show that pharmacological manipulations of noradrenergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic receptors can either slow or speed the processing of uncertainty. These effects depend on the type of experiment performed, and are not mutually exclusive.

In addition, L. pneumophila induces apoptosis in macrophages. The latter is a crucial host defense mechanism that protects macrophages from L. pneumophila infection. Recent in vitro experiments demonstrate that the enzyme caspase-1 is cleaved by the enzyme caspase-7. However, the biological role of caspase-7 activation downstream of the caspase-1 inflammasome is not known. Using the intracellular pathogen L. pneumophila, we show that, upon infection of macrophages, caspase-7 was activated downstream of the Nlrc4 inflammasome. Activation of caspase-7 was mediated by flagellin and required a functional Naip5. Such activation of caspase-7 was mediated by flagellin and required a functional Naip5. Remarkably, mice lacking caspase-7 and their macrophages allowed substantial L. pneumophila replication. Permissiveness of caspase-7\u2212/\u2212 macrophages to the intracellular pathogen was due to defective delivery of the organism to the lysosome and to delayed cell death during early stages of infection.

According to the classic model, the product of amplification is usually part of a linear or direct repeated sequence. According to the second model, the product of amplification is usually part of a genomic segment formed by a repeated sequence. In this work, we provide evidence that the Leishmania genome is continuously being rearranged at the level of these repeated sequences, which serve as a functional platform for constitutive and stochastic amplification. This process is adaptive as the copy number of advantageous extrachromosomal circular or linear elements increases upon selective pressure and is reversible when selection is removed. We also provide mechanistic insights on the formation of circular and linear amplicons through RAD51 recombinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. The whole genome of Leishmania is thus stochastically rearranged at the level of these repeated sequences, and the selection of parasite subpopulations with changes in the copy number of specific loci is used as a strategy to respond to a changing environment."

We here present a novel and comprehensive framework for using short-read sequence data to understand viral transmission events, designed for influenza virus, but adaptable to other viral species. Our approach solves several shortcomings of previous methods for this purpose. We consider transmission as an event involving whole viruses, rather than isolated viral particles, rather than independent viral alleles. We demonstrate how selection during transmission and noisy sequence data may each affect inferences of the population bottleneck, accounting for these in our framework so as to achieve a correct inference. We identify circumstances in which selection for increased viral transmission may or may not be identified from data, and apply our method to experimental data in which transmission occurs in the presence of strong selection, showing that our framework provides more quantitative insight into transmission events than previous approaches. Our work provides new opportunities for studying transmission processes in influenza, and by extension, in other infectious diseases."

The compaction of DNA is tightly regulated to ensure efficient transcription and to maintain genome stability. Chromatin structure and dynamics are also tightly regulated by various factors, but the specific link between the structural and functional state of chromatin remains poorly understood. Imitation SWI ( ISWI ) is a chromatin remodeling factor that is implicated in a variety of processes, including transcriptional regulation. Imitation is a member of the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, and its function is largely mediated through histone modifications. Recent studies have also implicated ISWI in the regulation of higher-order chromatin structure, but its role in this process remains poorly understood. Here we show that ISWI plays a global role in chromatin structure and dynamics by promoting the association of the linker histone H1 with chromatin. Our results suggest that ISWI plays a key role in chromatin structure and dynamics by promoting the association of H1 with chromatin."

Novel selective inhibitor of nuclear export ( SINE ) compounds, KPT-185, KPT-335, and KPT-350, target the host\u2019s primary nuclear export protein, CRM1, in a manner similar to the archetypical inhibitor Leptomycin B. We found that SINE compounds had no effect on VEEV TC83_Cm, which encodes a mutated form of capsid that is unable to enter the nucleus. Serially passaging VEEV in the presence of KPT-185 resulted in mutations within the nuclear localization and nuclear export signals of capsid. Finally, SINE compound treatment also reduced the viral titers of the related eastern and western equine encephalitis viruses, suggesting that CRM1 maintains a common interaction with capsid proteins across the New World alphavirus genus."

A popular model of learning is the persistent activity-dependent theory which postulates that learning is maintained by modifications of synapses that are induced by specific patterns of pre- and postsynaptic activity. The persistence theory assumes that the activity in the brain is taken up by synapses in such a way that, at any time in the past, the synapses can be modified to be active. In this paper, we investigate the time scales of memory maintenance in a calcium-based synaptic plasticity model that has been shown recently to be able to fit different experimental data-sets from hippocampal and neocortical preparations. We find that in the presence of background activity on the order of 1 Hz parameters that fit pyramidal layer 5 neocortical data lead to a very fast decay of synaptic efficacy, with time scales of minutes. We then identify two ways in which this memory time scale can be extended: ( i ) the extracellular calcium concentration used to fit the model are larger than estimated concentrations in vivo, and ( ii ) adding a bistability mechanism so that each synapse has two stable states at sufficiently low background activity. Our results are obtained first in a single synapse connecting two independent Poisson neurons, and then in simulations of a large network of excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons. Our results emphasise the need for studying plasticity at physiological extracellular calcium concentration, and highlight the role of synaptic bi- or multistability in the stability of learned synaptic structures."

We show that the anteroposterior patterning of the otic vesicle is regulated by a signalling pathway that is initiated by the fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) and retinoic acid ( RA ) signalling pathways. In one case, RA signalling has opposing effects on the development of the inner ear cells; in another case, RA signalling acts in a feedback loop that restricts the expression of the otx1b gene, which is required for the formation of non-neural cells.

The mechanisms by which these organisms control their movement are not fully understood. Serotonin is a very important neurotransmitter in all parasitic helminths and serotonin is strongly myoexcitatory; it potentiates contraction of the body wall muscles and stimulates motor activity. This is considered to be a critical mechanism of motor control in the parasite, but the mode of action of serotonin is poorly understood. Here we provide the first molecular evidence of a functional serotonin receptor ( Sm5HTR ) in S. mansoni. Functional expression studies in transfected HEK 293 cells showed that Sm5HTR is a specific serotonin receptor and it signals through an increase in intracellular cAMP, consistent with a 5HT7 signaling mechanism. Immunolocalization studies with a specific anti-Sm5HTR antibody revealed that the receptor is abundantly distributed in the worm's nervous system, including the cerebral ganglia and the peripheral innervation of the body wall muscles and tegument. RNA interference was performed both in schistosomulae and adult worms to test whether the receptor is required for parasite movement. The results show that Sm5HTR is at least one of the receptors responsible for the motor effects of serotonin in S. mansoni."

We discovered that L* potently inhibits the interferon-inducible OAS/RNase L pathway. The antagonism of RNase L by L* was particularly prominent in macrophages where baseline oligoadenylate synthetase ( OAS ) and RNase L expression levels are elevated. L* mutations significantly affected Theiler's virus replication in primary macrophages derived from wild-type but not from RNase L-deficient mice. L* counteracted the OAS/RNase L pathway through direct interaction with the ankyrin domain of RNase L, resulting in the inhibition of this enzyme. Interestingly, RNase L inhibition was species-specific as Theiler's virus L* protein blocked murine RNase L but not human RNase L or RNase L of other mammals or birds. Direct RNase L inhibition by L* and species specificity were confirmed in an in vitro assay performed with purified proteins.

Thus, understanding the mechanisms of plant cell expansion and the plant hormone auxin is of great interest. We show that the Arabidopsis thaliana growth hormone AtRALF1 negatively regulates root cell expansion. AtRALF1 is a root-specific growth hormone that negatively regulates the activity of the auxin signaling pathway. At the same time, AtRALF1 induces an increase in the phosphorylation of its receptor BAK1.

Thereby, we focused on the functional characterization of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, WWP2, a top candidate in the Notch3 interactome list. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that WWP2 interacted with N3-ICD but not with intracellular domains from other Notch receptors. Wild-type WWP2 but not ligase-deficient mutant WWP2 increased mono-ubiquitination of the membrane-tethered Notch3 fragment, therefore attenuating Notch3 pathway activity in cancer cells and leading to cell cycle arrest. The ubiquitination by WWP2 may target an endosomal/lysosomal degradation fate for Notch3 as suggested by the fact that the process could be suppressed by the endosomal/lysosomal inhibitor. Furthermore, the majority of ovarian carcinomas harbored homozygous or heterozygous deletions in WWP2 locus, and there was an inverse correlation in the expression levels between WWP2 and Notch3 in ovarian carcinomas.

One of the most important principles of the nervous system is the creation of circuits that capitalize on this predictability. Previous work has identified differences in the distributions of basic visual features in natural images that are relevant to the encoding tasks of the visual system. We report that the well-established statistical distributions of visual features ( e. g., visual contrast, spatial scale, and depth ) differ between bright and dark image components. Following this analysis, we go on to trace how these differences in natural images translate into different patterns of cortical input that arise from the separate bright ( ON ) and dark ( OFF ) pathways. Our results indicate that there are regularities in visual cortical input beyond those that have previously been appreciated from the direct analysis of natural images. In particular, several dark/bright asymmetries provide a potential account for recently discovered asymmetries in how the brain processes visual features, such as violations of classic energy-type models."

Here we show that the Esx-1 secretion system promotes inflammation and disease in a mouse model of M. marium infection. Infection with Esx-1-deficient bacteria led to severe pathology, including the formation of granulomas similar to those observed in human tuberculosis. We also found that Esx-1-dependent inflammation required the host NLRP3 and ASC proteins. Infection of wild type and ASC-deficient mice demonstrated that these two factors are required to control inflammation. These findings suggest that the Esx-1 secretion system promotes disease and inflammation through its ability to activate the inflammasome."

The loss of APC function is believed to inhibit degradation of \u03b2\u2014catenin, which is regulated by a multiprotein complex called the destruction complex.

The kinases and, which are recruited by Axin, mediate phosphorylation of \u03b2\u2014catenin, which initiates its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Through formulation and analysis of a rule-based computational model, we investigated the mechanism of regulation of \u03b2\u2014catenin degradation by the destruction complex and the role of truncation of APC in colorectal cancer. We found that the phosphorylated truncated form of APC can outcompete Axin for binding to \u03b2\u2014catenin, provided that Axin is limiting, and thereby sequester \u03b2\u2014catenin away from Axin and the Axin-recruited kinases and. Full-length APC also competes with Axin for binding to \u03b2\u2014catenin; however, full-length APC is able, through its SAMP repeats, to bind Axin and to which is missing in truncated oncogenic forms of APC. Our results suggest that the positive effects of truncated APC on \u03b2\u2014catenin levels depend on phosphorylation of APC, at the first 20-amino acid repeat, and that phosphorylation of this site is mediated by, and is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in colorectal cancer."

Histone deacetylase 1 ( HDAC1 ) expression, activity and binding to the defense gene promoters significantly increased during infection, which resulted in decreased histone H3 acetylation in infected cells. HDAC overexpression enhanced infection, whereas pharmacologic and siRNA HDAC1 inhibition significantly decreased bacterial load. HDAC2 does not seem to be involved, since HDAC silencing by siRNA had no effect on A. phagocytophilum intracellular propagation.

A well-known regulator of retinal gene expression is the transcription factor NRL, which is responsible for activating the expression of many retinal genes. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the transcription factor network that underlies rod photoreceptor function. Our analysis identified a network comprised of 300 direct NRL targets. We also investigated the function of a class of transcription factors that control the expression of many retinal genes. We found that these transcription factors are clustered into functional units called cis-regulatory modules, and that several of these transcription factor modules have been identified in prior studies. Our analysis also identified novel genes that are controlled by NRL. We also identified a novel function for one of these transcription factors, Kdm5b, and demonstrated that it regulates rod-expressed genes.

We also show that there is little change in the evolutionary rate of the antibody complementarity determining regions ( CDRs ), which are the most important functional regions for the immune system. Our results suggest that the slow rate of change in the CDRs, in turn, is caused by the slow rate of change in the antibody variable region.

The correlation between the Darwinian selection strength and the evolutionary rate trended toward significance, but cannot fully explain the observed changes in evolutionary rate.

Analysis of the time course microarray data demonstrated SREB functioned as a transcriptional regulator at 37\u00b0C and 22\u00b0C. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses indicated SREB is involved in diverse biological processes including iron homeostasis, biosynthesis of triacylglycerol and ergosterol, and lipid droplet formation.

Foamy macrophages ( FMs ), a type of mycobacterial-specific immune cells, have been described to be present in granulomas of TB patients, and are able to sequester the bacteria. We have analyzed the interaction of the TB bacillus with human macrophages, and have identified that oxygenated mycolic acids ( MA ), which are produced by macrophages, play a crucial role in the differentiation of these cells. Mycobacteria long chain fatty acids ( MA ) induce FMs, which migrate to macrophages and convert into FMs. In vitro culture of human macrophages, we have found that this process is mediated by the presence of MA in the bacterial cell, and that the mycobacteria enter the macrophages in association with the lipid droplets. We conclude that oxygenated MA plays a key role in the interaction of the TB bacillus with macrophages, and that FMs might be a relevant reservoir for the long-term persistence of the bacteria."

Cutin-containing layers are present in seed coats of numerous species, including Arabidopsis, where they regulate permeability to outer compounds. However, the role of cutin in mature seed physiology and germination remains poorly understood.

These sequences are transcriptionally silenced, and heterochromatin, a specialized chromatin structure that packaging is a key feature of many genomes. A major challenge in biology is to understand how silencing mechanisms are maintained over many millions of years of evolution. While the epigenetic information that exists in chromatin is well known, much less is known about how silencing mechanisms are maintained. We have used the inducible mis-expression of a bantam microRNA in the fruit fly eye to recover new factors that affect silencing caused by the bantam mutation. We find that heterochromatin promotes silencing, and that the mechanisms involved are diverse. We also show that the bantam microRNA de-represses silencing when expressed in cycling cells. Our analysis reveals that heterochromatin is not necessary to maintain the cell cycle, and instead de-represses silencing when the cell cycle is held back. Surprisingly, continual over-expression of the crol microRNA accelerates the cell cycle, and this is required for de-repression of silencing. Our analysis reveals that chromatin states can be efficiently inherited through cell divisions, with implications for the stable maintenance of gene expression patterns through development."

Our model predicts that, under some scenarios, recombination may dramatically influence viral load changes.

We have used next generation sequencing to determine the mutation rate in a common host ( eggplant ) of two viroids: the chloroplastic eggplant latent viroid ( ELVd ) and the nuclear potato spindle tuber viroid ( PSTVd ). This revealed higher mutation frequencies in ELVd than in PSTVd, and marked differences in the types of mutations produced. Rates of spontaneous mutation, quantified in vivo using the lethal mutation method, ranged from 1/1000 to 1/800 for ELVd and from 1/7000 to 1/3800 for PSTVd depending on sequencing run.

Ligation of both LFA-1 and NKG2D together resulted in symmetrical spreading but co-ligation of inhibitory receptors reverted NK cells to an asymmetrical migratory configuration leading to inhibitory synapses being smaller and more rapidly disassembled.

Together, these data demonstrate that NK cells spread to form large stable, symmetrical synapses if activating signals dominate, whereas asymmetrical migratory \u201ckinapses\u201d are favoured if inhibitory signals dominate.

Moreover, deletion of clpP or clpS/clpA results in enhanced bacterial survival in a mouse model of acute pneumonia infection. This study uncovers that CdpR is a novel QS regulator in P. aeruginosa and that its adaptor protein ClpS directly interacts with CdpR to control CdpR degradation. Our results reveal that CdpR is a novel QS regulator that can directly influence virulence gene expression and pathogenicity."

To do this, animals must learn to associate multiple sensory signals in a noisy sensory environment with their internal state. While many models have been developed to predict the response to a given stimulus, they have not been able to incorporate variable response timing and/or state dependence of the neural code. We present a novel method for modeling variable response timing and state dependence. Our method, which we call response alignment, is based on a combination of information theory and Markov chain theory. We show that it is a more efficient method than previous approaches. We also apply our method to recorded data of birds on a variety of tasks, demonstrating how it can be used to learn the responses to complex stimuli."

In the Philippines, data on cholera in the past are sparse, making it difficult to determine areas at high risk for cholera. Here, we assessed the incidence of cholera in the Philippines using sentinel surveillance data and reported on the number of suspected cases from 2008\u20132013. Our results showed that the overall case fatality ratio was 0. 62%, but was 2% in outbreaks. The number of suspected cases varied by age group, with children under 6 being most affected. We also found that access to improved water supplies was associated with higher cholera incidence. Our findings confirm that cholera affects a large proportion of the provinces in the country. Identifying areas most at risk for cholera will support the development and implementation of policies to mitigate the morbidity and mortality due to this disease."

Despite their impact, little is known about these parasites and their interplay with the host at the molecular level. Recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics provide unique opportunities to gain improved insights into the biology of parasites as well as their relationships with their hosts at the molecular level. Here, we describe the use of next-generation sequencing and advanced in silico analyses to identify genes expressed in the parasites and their interplay with the host. The results of this study could assist in defining molecules that are essential for the development, reproduction and survival of liver flukes and/or that are linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma."

Here we have identified a DNA methylation variant that is associated with childhood obesity. We found that the DNA methylation variant, which is a hypermethylation variant, interferes with binding of the transcription enhancer P300 and reduces the expression of the POMC transcript. We also show that the hypermethylation variant is located in the genomic vicinity of the POMC locus, a region known to be associated with methylation. The POMC locus is also located in the vicinity of the Alu element, a known to influence methylation in the promoter region. The hypermethylation variant thus results from an Alu element\u2013triggered default state of methylation boundary definition. The POMC locus is a genetic polymorphism that is known to be under strong epigenetic control. Therefore, this methylation variant is a unique example of a single-nucleotide polymorphism that is associated with a complex phenotype."

It has been known for over 30 years that APOBEC3G is present in human T cells and can inhibit HIV-1 replication. However, the specific deaminase activity of endogenous APOBEC3G in human T cells has not been examined directly. Here, we compared the deaminase activity of endogenous A3G in various human cell lines using a standard assay and a novel, quantitative, high-throughput assay. Exogenous A3G in epithelial cell lysates displayed deaminase activity only following RNase treatment, as expected given that A3G is known to form an enzymatically inactive RNA-containing complex. Surprisingly, endogenous A3G exhibited minimal deaminase activity, despite RNase treatment. Furthermore, we found that deaminase activity of endogenous A3G in human T cell lines and in resting or activated primary CD4+ T cells was reduced by up to 36-fold. Furthermore, RNase-treated T cell lysates inhibited epithelial cell lysates expressing enzymatically active A3G. These studies suggest that T cells, unlike epithelial-derived cell lines, express an unidentified RNase-resistant factor that inhibits A3G deaminase activity. This factor could be responsible for reduced levels of hypermutation in T cells, and its identification and blockade could offer a means for increasing antiretroviral intrinsic immunity of T cells."

Available conjugate vaccines target only a small subset of >90 serotypes of S. pneumoniae and, since their introduction, increases in non-vaccine serotypes have been recorded in several countries: a phenomenon termed Vaccine-Induced Serotype Replacement ( VISR ). In this study, we show that vaccination can cause changes in the metabolism and virulence-associated components of S. pneumoniae to transfer through recombination to non-vaccine serotypes: a phenomenon we term Vaccine-Induced Metabolic Shift ( VIMS ). Our results provide a novel explanation for changes observed in the population structure of the pneumococcus following vaccination, and have important implications for strain-targeted vaccination in a range of infectious disease systems."

We begin by re-examining an influential but controversial characterization of the dynamic modularity of the S. cerevisiae interactome that incorporated gene expression data into network analysis. We show that the dynamic modularity and modularity of the interaction networks of five organisms are inextricably linked, and that the functions and structural properties of hub proteins that are co-expressed with their interacting partners and those that are not, are strongly correlated with these properties. Our results demonstrate that in each of these organisms, simple topological measures are significantly correlated with the co-expression of a hub with its partners, independent of any classification, and hence also reflect protein intra- and inter- modularity. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that hub proteins tend to be conserved across organisms. Overall, we provide evidence that purely topological features of static interaction networks reflect aspects of the dynamics and modularity of interactomes as well as previous measures incorporating expression data, and are a powerful means for understanding the dynamic roles of hubs in interactomes."

We show that there are important differences in the spatial distribution of NTDs and HIV risk across this population, with important differences in infection risk for the gastrointestinal helminths, Schistosoma mansoni, Taenia solium, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura. This spatial variation is not observed for HIV, but is correlated with other important NTDs, such as malaria and TB. The results of this study provide a foundation for understanding the complex ecology of NTDs and contribute to the targeting of interventions."

H. pylori infection is initiated when H. pylori first interacts with gastric tissue, and is thought to be facilitated by a microenvironment that is provided by the gastric lining. We have previously shown that H. pylori preferentially colonizes the ulcerated area in the presence of gastric resident Lactobacillus spp. We investigated whether other bacterial factors are important to ulcer healing and gastric damage. We found that H. pylori motility ( chemotaxis ) and the ability to sense chemicals ( chemotaxis ) are important to ulcer healing and gastric damage. Our results provide important new insight into H. pylori pathogenesis, which is important for developing therapeutic strategies that target these pathogens."

However, the functional conformation of the HAP2 fusion loops has remained unknown, as the reported X-ray structure of the model yeast Chlamydomonas reinhardtii HAP2 lacked this critical region. Here, we report the structure-guided alignment of the proposed HAP2 fusion loops. Our results reveal that in flowering plants, HAP2 has a single prominent fusion loop projecting an amphipathic helix at its apex, while in trypanosomes, three small nonpolar loops of HAP2 are poised to interact with the target membrane. A detailed structure-function analysis of the Arabidopsis HAP2 amphipathic fusion helix defines key residues that are essential for membrane insertion and for gamete fusion. Our study suggests that HAP2 may have evolved multiple modes of membrane insertion to accommodate the diversity of membrane environments encountered during eukaryotic evolution."

The four DENV serotypes are the cause of a spectrum of clinical disease ranging from mild fever to potentially life-threatening haemorrhagic fever and hypovolemic shock. There is no licensed vaccine or antiviral therapy available to treat dengue disease. The lack of a vaccine has been a major impediment to dengue control and research. In recent years, the use of RNA interference ( RNAi ) has been shown to be effective at blocking dengue disease symptoms. In this study, we identified a conserved site in the 5\u2032 non-translated region ( NTR ) of the viral genome that is targeted by short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ). We used a human adenovirus type 5 ( AdV5 ) vector to deliver a short-hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) targeting this site into cells. We show that this shRNA can inhibit the replication of all four DENV serotypes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using AdV5-mediated delivery of shRNA targeting conserved sites in the viral genome to inhibit infection by all four DENV serotypes. This opens the way towards exploring RNAi as a therapeutic strategy to curtail dengue infection."

Recent evidence suggests that tumors are structured in a very similar way, mirroring the hierarchical structure of the host tissue. In some tissues, differentiated cells can also revert to the stem cell phenotype, which increases the risk that mutant cells lead to long lasting clones in the tissue. However, it is unclear under which circumstances de-differentiating cells will invade a tissue. Here, we develop mathematical models to investigate how de-differentiation is selected as an adaptive mechanism in the context of cellular hierarchies. We find that de-differentiation is most likely to be favored provided stem cells having the largest effective self-renewal rate. Moreover, de-differentiation also provides a wider range of favorable conditions than stepwise de-differentiation. Finally, the effect of de-differentiation on the redistribution of self-renewal and differentiation probabilities also greatly influences the selection for de-differentiation."

There are three types of cuticle proteins in insects, which are named TcCPR1, TcCPR2 and TcCPR3. The TcCPR27 protein is one of the most abundant cuticle proteins ( CP ), which can be further divided into three subgroups based on the presence of one of the three sequence motifs denoted as Rebers-Riddiford ( R&R ) consensus sequence motifs RR-1, RR-2 and RR-3. In the present study, we investigated the function ( s ) of another CP, TcCPR4, which contains the RR-2 motif. We found that TcCPR4 is present in the rigid cuticles of the dorsal elytron, ventral abdomen and leg but not in the flexible cuticles of the hindwing and dorsal abdomen of adult T. castaneum. TcCPR4 protein is predominantly localized in pore canals and regions around the apical plasma membrane protrusions into the procuticle of rigid adult cuticles. RNAi for TcCPR4 resulted in an abnormal shape of the pore canals with amorphous pore fibers ( PCFs ) in their lumen. These results support the hypothesis that TcCPR4 is required for achieving proper morphology of the vertical pore canals and PCFs that contribute to the assembly of a cuticle that is both lightweight and rigid."

Phytochromes ( phyA to phyE ) are a large and diverse group of light-sensing receptors. The phytochrome N-terminal 651-amino acid domain binds to regulatory light signals in the cell nucleus and acts to perceive and transduce these signals. To define functional roles for these subdomains, we have mutated an Arabidopsis thaliana gene called N651 to generate a series of novel mutations. We found 14 mutations in the N651 domain that affect the function of this gene. We found that these mutations clustered into two classes: light-signal perception mutants and signaling mutants. Most spectral mutants were found in the N-terminal extension and the per-antennal region of the phytochrome and in the per-antennal region of the per-antennal region of the phytochrome. On the other hand, the signaling mutants were found in the per-antennal region and in the per-antennal region of the phytochrome. These observations indicate that the N-terminal extension and per-antennal region of the phytochrome are involved in signal transfer, but that the per-antennal region of the phytochrome is responsible for light perception."
