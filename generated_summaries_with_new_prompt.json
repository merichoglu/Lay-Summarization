Influenza epidemics are driven by a high mutation rate, and the rapid evolution of influenza viruses has made it difficult to develop an influenza vaccine capable of providing protection against all circulating influenza strains. We have used a recombinant influenza virus expressing the highly conserved LCMV GP33-41 epitope to show that CD8+ T cells and virus-specific non-neutralizing antibodies each are relatively ineffective at providing protection against heterosubtypic influenza virus infections. We also demonstrate that this improvement in protection is dependent, at least in part, on alveolar macrophages and/or other lung phagocytes. Overall, our studies suggest that an influenza vaccine capable of eliciting both CD8+ T cells and antibodies specific for highly conserved influenza proteins may be able to provide protection against heterosubtypic influenza virus infections in humans. This improved protection is dependent, at least in part, on alveolar macrophages and/or other lung phagocytes.

The disease is often clinically asymptomatic, but a severe form, termed mucosal leishmaniasis, is characterized by a severe inflammatory response that perpetuates the disease. Here, we investigated what cytokines contribute to increased pathology in the absence of IL-10 regulation. Mice lacking IL-10 regulation developed larger lesions than controls, but fewer parasites. Both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 levels were substantially elevated in mice lacking the capacity to respond to IL-10. IFN-\u03b3 promoted an increased infiltration of monocytes, while IL-17 contributed to an increase in neutrophils. Surprisingly, however, the ability of IFN-\u03b3 to control IL-17 was not necessary for the development of pathology. Thus, we propose that regulating IL-17, possibly by downregulating IL-1\u03b2, may be a useful approach for controlling immunopathology in leishmaniasis."

The Kcnq1 imprinted domain is a typical example of such a complex tissue-specific expression pattern, where each gene is expressed only in one tissue or group of tissues, while others are expressed in multiple tissues or organs. The Kcnq1 imprint is a cis-regulatory element that is activated when the Kcnq1 transcript is absent in the early embryo. The activity of this element can also be repressed by the Kcnq1ot1 protein. We used Kcnq1ot1 to study the role of Kcnq1 in heart development. We found that the Kcnq1ot1 protein is essential for normal heart development, and we could show that it is required for Kcnq1ot1 to be expressed in the heart. Furthermore, we find that Kcnq1ot1 is required for Kcnq1 to be expressed in later stages of development. We also show that Kcnq1ot1 can affect the accessibility of Kcnq1 to regulatory elements, and thus the expression level of Kcnq1. This work reveals a novel mechanism by which an antisense RNA can affect transcription through regulating chromatin flexibility and access to enhancers."

Current approaches to the analysis of human genetic variation focus on predicting disease risk factors for each individual, and testing these predictions using genetic data from existing studies. However, recent advances in genome sequencing technologies allow direct comparison of genetic variation across individuals, providing an opportunity to assess the extent of variation in the human genome. Here, we present a new method to analyze data from a large sample of genetic variation in individuals from a population with non-stationary demographic history ( e. g., modern humans ). We show that our method predicts that a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry, as well as an ancestral population of Europeans, has been primarily responsible for the increase in genetic variation in the sample. We also show that many of the identified genetic variants are neutral or nearly neutral ( i. e., they are both neutral and slightly deleterious ). Our results indicate that many of the identified genetic variants are neutral or may be slightly deleterious, but that the majority are deleterious or lethal. Our method can be used to assess the extent of genetic variation in other populations, and in particular in studies of the genetic basis of disease and other traits."

The JNK pathway is known to be important for the control of cell proliferation and the growth of germ cells, and mutations in this pathway lead to premature ovarian insufficiency ( POI ), an inherited disorder.

Interestingly, these defects are not observed in mice lacking other types of channels, indicating that these channels are required in a similar way. However, we also found that mutations in seizure channel are responsible for extensive remodeling of the heart muscle, suggesting that seizure channel mutations can lead to different types of cardiac defects."

Cc is a small, soluble, highly conserved electron carrier protein that coordinates the electron flow among different redox systems. Starting from the structures of individual proteins, we performed extensive conformational sampling of the Cc complexes, and analyzed the upper limit of the ET rate in different binding geometries. Our results provide a complete picture of the Cc interactome, and show that most ET-competent binding geometries are located in electrostatically favorable regions, and suggest that the ET can take place from more than one protein-protein orientation.

In this study, we show that 5-HT regulates insulin secretion by binding to and inhibiting the activity of the small GTPases. We show that this inhibition is mediated by the direct interaction of 5-HT with GTPases. We also show that this inhibition is mediated by the activation of serotonylation, a modification of the 5-HT signal that occurs inside the cell. Serotonylation is known to be involved in various physiological functions and is well known to regulate insulin secretion.

To address the function of SLC25A38, we took advantage of the fact that mitochondrial glycine transporters are present in almost all eukaryotic cells, and we have identified a second SLC25 family member, Ymc1, as a potential mitochondrial glycine importer. We show that high levels of exogenous glycine, or 5-aminolevulinic acid ( 5-Ala ) a metabolite downstream of Hem25 in heme biosynthetic pathway, were able to restore heme levels to normal in yeast cells lacking Hem25 function. While neither glycine nor 5-Ala could ameliorate SLC25A38 congenital sideroblastic anemia in a zebrafish model, we determined that the addition of folate with glycine was able to restore hemoglobin levels. This difference is likely due to the fact that yeast can synthesize folate, whereas in zebrafish folate is an essential vitamin that must be obtained exogenously. Given the tolerability of glycine and folate in humans, this study points to a potential novel treatment for SLC25A38 congenital sideroblastic anemia."

To further explore the mechanism involved in the control of arg1 expression, we screened a panel of kinase inhibitors and found that inhibitors of growth factor signaling reduced arg1 expression in infected macrophages. Inhibition of the downstream signaling molecules JAK and AKT reduced the expression of arg1 in infected macrophages, as well as STAT6, a key transcription factor in the pathway. STAT6 was activated in infected macrophages exposed to FGF-2 or IGF-1, and STAT6 was critical to the induction of arg1. These data indicate that the FGF-2/IGF-1R and IL-4 signaling pathways converge at STAT6 to promote pathologic arg1 expression and intracellular parasite survival."

In communities where the district level prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular among children ages 1\u20139 years is \u22655%, WHO recommends annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of antibiotics with the aim of at least 80% coverage. Population-based coverage surveys are essential to understand the effectiveness of MDA programs, yet published reports from trachoma programs are rare. In the Amhara region of Ethiopia, a population-based coverage survey was conducted 3 weeks following the 2016 MDA to estimate the zonal prevalence of self-reported drug coverage in all 10 administrative zones. The regional self-reported antibiotic coverage was 76. 8% ( 95% Confidence Interval ( CI ) :69. 3\u201382. 9% ) in the population, and 77. 4% ( 95% CI = 65. 7\u201385. 9% ) among children ages 1\u20139 years. Zonal coverage ranged from 67. 8% to 90. 2%. Five out of 10 zones achieved a coverage >80%. In all zones, the reported administrative coverage was greater than 90% and was considerably higher than self-reported MDA coverage. Our results will be used to enhance community mobilization and improve training for MDA distributors and supervisors to improve coverage in future MDAs."

Here, we investigated the association between lack of access to water and sanitation and STH infection. We enrolled 6957 individuals from the province of Salta, Argentina, and randomly selected them for diagnosis of STH infection and infection with STH parasites. We found that unimproved drinking water was significantly associated with increased STH infection.

Lack of safe water and proper sanitation were significantly associated with increased STH infection of orally ingested STH species. Our findings support the importance of improving access to water and sanitation for STH transmission, and the recommendation of interventions to control STH in endemic countries."

The World Health Organization recommends the use of rainwater cisterns as an intervention to reduce the risk of giardiasis. However, few epidemiological studies have been conducted to assess the health risks and the protection effects associated with consumption of this water source. We performed a study to assess the risk of infection with Giardia duodenalis in children living in a semi-arid region of Brazil. We followed 332 children aged between 4 months and 5 years who lived in a small village. We found that the prevalence of Giardia duodenalis infection in children was higher when compared to children who did not have access to rainwater cisterns. The other factors associated with Giardia infection were: number of rooms per house ( OR 0. 89 ) ; family income ( OR 0. 48 ) ; birth order ( OR 1. 72 ) ; preterm children ( OR 1. 70 ) ; and improper hand hygiene. Our results suggest that access to rainwater cistern is associated with a lower prevalence of Giardia duodenalis infection in children after adjustment for environmental and family-related factors.

However, a large number of viral genomes is necessary to replicate and activate cellular machinery to start an infection. We also predicted that this effect is enhanced by cell-to-cell variation in the replication abilities of viral genomes. Importantly, this effect is observed in vivo, as observed in tobacco cells.

This integration is very rapid and involves only a few brain areas, while the first pathway takes on a much slower integration. The key element of this rapid perceptual integration is the rapid integration of several sensory inputs backpropagating from the first stage to the second. The first stage is highly sensitive to the intrinsic properties of the sensory inputs, which can be readily visualized by the brain.

We studied the molecular mechanism of how the chromatin structure impacts the ability of the virus to integrate its DNA into the host cell DNA. We found that the chromatin structure has a dramatic effect on the efficiency of the DNA integration process. Specifically, chromatin structure influences the accessibility of the DNA to the cellular machinery responsible for integrating the viral DNA into the cell DNA.

We quantitatively analysed voltage-dependent activation of HCN2 channels and its modulation by cAMP using a novel computational method. We show that cAMP increases the voltage-dependent activation of HCN2 channels by stabilising the channel pore.

While the virus causes disease, it also evades the immune system by suppressing the host antiviral immune response. How EBV achieves this evasion is not well understood. The gamma-herpesvirus EBV activates Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ), including TLR2, TLR3, and TLR9. TLRs induce expression of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, which are critical for activating the immune system to control infection. To allow replication, replication, and persistence, ( herpes ) viruses employ ingenious strategies to evade host immunity.

We also found that the retinoic acid signaling reporter line was associated with the opsin gene array. The retinoic acid signaling reporter line provided evidence that individual opsin cells switched from the primary LWS2 opsin gene array to the tandemly duplicated LWS opsin array. The retinoic acid signaling reporter line also demonstrated that this opsin switch was induced by retinoic acid signaling. The retinoic acid signaling reporter line provided evidence that the opsin array is regulated by retinoic acid signaling in a tandemly duplicated array. This is the first evidence that an extracellular signaling pathway can regulate differential expression of opsin genes in a tandemly duplicated array."

These transitions are critical for pathogenicity and host-finding and invasion. However, in zygomycetes, whether hyphal growth switches to yeast or filamentous growth is a central unanswered question. We found that the calcineurin pathway controls hyphal growth and virulence in the human fungal pathogenic zygomycete Mucor circinelloides. We also found that the single calcineurin B subunit, CnaA, is critical for this process. When CnaA was inactivated, M. circinelloides locked in permanent yeast growth and produced less virulent strains than the wild-type strain. We also found that the single calcineurin B subunit is involved in the dimorphic transition from yeast to hyphae, and this subunit is necessary for the virulence of the M. circinelloides in a host system. Our results demonstrate that the calcineurin pathway orchestrates the yeast-hyphal and spore size dimorphic transitions that contribute to virulence of this common zygomycete fungal pathogen."

Here, we have developed a novel technology to block malaria transmission of anopheline mosquitoes that express the C-type lectin CEL-III from sea cucumber in a midgut-specific manner. The transgenic mosquitoes exhibit strong and rapid hemolysis toward human red blood cells in vitro and in vivo. We show that CEL-III has strong and rapid hemolysis toward red blood cells in the presence of serum. Interestingly, when the hemolysis of CCL-III was blocked in vitro, ookinetes, the mosquito stage responsible for parasite development, were not efficiently formed. In addition, the development of Plasmodium falciparum, the most important human malaria parasite, was blocked in the presence of CCL-III. We show that the CCL-III induced a significant inhibition toward ookinetes, and that it also kills Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first time that CCL-III has been shown to block malaria development of a human malaria vector. These findings have significant implications for the development of refractory mosquitoes to all species of human Plasmodium and elucidation of mosquito\u2013parasite interactions."

The mosquito olfactory system is the first described organ that enables mosquito larvae to find and seek a host, and is critical for development of the mosquito\u2019s ability to survive and multiply. In this study, we have used behavioral assays and gene silencing to identify genes required for proper olfactory function in the mosquito A. gambiae. We have identified two new genes that are required for proper olfactory function in both the adult mosquito and the larva. The first gene, AgIR1, is a member of a family of olfactory receptor genes, and is involved in the response to the chemical insecticide DEET, which is used by mosquitoes to identify hosts and seek a blood meal. The second gene, AgIR2, is required for proper olfactory function in both the adult mosquito and the larva. Our results reveal that different olfactory signaling mechanisms are used in these two mosquito species, and that the second gene is involved in the response to insecticide. These findings may provide new insights into the development of new strategies for the control of this medically important disease."

In addition, we show that TEs are less frequently interrupted in introns than in intergenic regions, supporting the hypothesis that these sequences may be functionally important.

In mammals, FAK has been shown to be overexpressed in many human cancers. However, the role of FAK in cancer development is unclear. We found that FAK suppresses RTK signalling in Drosophila epithelia, and human cancer cells. Specifically, FAK reduced receptor recycling into the plasma membrane, which resulted in lower MAPK activation. Conversely, increasing the plasma membrane of receptor and MAPK pathway activated FAK. Therefore, FAK is a suppressor of RTK signalling in both Drosophila and human cancer cells."

The parasite Leishmania mexicana is the causative agent of the disease, which is transmitted by sandflies. In the mammalian host, this parasite replicates inside macrophages and causes a chronic infection that can progress to a deadly disease. The parasite first replicates inside macrophages and then grows to the point where it is amenable to killing by immune cells. The parasite can also proliferate inside macrophages and live for many years, making the infection chronic. The parasite has a complex metabolism that is unique to the intracellular lifestyle. We used 13C-stable isotope-resolved metabolomics and 2H2O labelling to show that the metabolism of the parasite is distinct from that of the host. This metabolic state is associated with reduced growth rate and increased metabolic dependence on glucose and amino acids. These metabolic changes are coupled to the differentiation signals rather than to external nutrient levels. Induction of a stringent metabolic response may facilitate amastigote survival in a nutrient-poor intracellular niche and underlie the increased dependence of this stage on hexose and mitochondrial metabolism."

Using temperature inducible degron fusions of all essential RSC subunits, we set out to map RSC requirement as a function of the mitotic cell cycle. We found that RSC executes essential functions during G1, G2, and mitosis. Remarkably, we observed a doubling of chromosome complements when degron alleles of the RSC subunit SFH1, the yeast hSNF5 tumor suppressor ortholog, and RSC3 were combined. The requirement for simultaneous deregulation of SFH1 and RSC3 to induce these ploidy shifts was eliminated by knockout of the S-phase cyclin Cdc6p and by transient depletion of replication origin licensing factor Cdc6p. Further, combination of the degron alleles of SFH1 and RSC3, with deletion alleles of each of the nine cyclin genes, revealed a strong and specific genetic interaction between the S-phase cyclin genes CLB5 and RSC3, indicating a role for RSC-mediated chromatin remodeling in ploidy maintenance. Our results implicate RSC in regulation of the G1/S-phase transition and establish a hitherto unanticipated role for RSC-mediated chromatin remodeling in ploidy maintenance."

We observed that macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis became more susceptible to death and that this effect depended on the bacterial load. In the lungs of infected mice, we observed that a small number of lung cells, called macrophages, were highly infected with M. tuberculosis and were more likely to die than other cells. We also observed that this intracellular infection was associated with a large proportion of the bacilli that were lost from the lung. Our data indicate that in vivo bacterial load per cell is an important determinant of macrophage death and that the large bacilli that are released from the lung do not survive to reach the lung, but instead cause cell death. Our data suggest that the intracellular infection of macrophages is a major cause of cell death and that this effect may contribute to the mechanism of disease."

Simultaneous single unit recordings show that an increase in the spatial extent of stimuli increases correlations at short timescales while simultaneously reducing correlations at long timescales. A network model replicates this correlation shaping, under the assumptions that spatially broad stimuli both saturate feedforward afferent input and recruit an open-loop inhibitory feedback pathway. Our model predictions are experimentally verified using both the natural heterogeneity of the electrosensory system and pharmacological blockade of descending feedback projections. We show that the reduction of long timescale correlation for spatially broad stimuli is similar to correlation canceling mechanisms previously suggested to be operational in mammalian cortex."

The structure of a protein is determined by X-ray crystallography and other experimental techniques. However, the 3D structure of a protein is still unclear, and the experimental data is noisy and incomplete. Thus, it is crucial to develop approaches to predict the structure of a protein from experimental data. These methods can be divided into two main steps. First, the determination of a set of amino acid residues that are present in the structure of the protein and second, the identification of the amino acid residues that are present in the protein structure and are not in the unbound form. The former requires the assumption that a given amino acid can be modeled in the unbound form, while the latter requires the assumption that all such residues are present in the unbound form. We present a new method, called Partial Order Optimum Likelihood ( POOL ), that accomplishes both of these goals. Our method is shown to be more efficient than the current state-of-the-art methods that are currently employed to identify active residues in protein 3D structures."

EBV infection of B cells, in the context of a \u201cmystoma\u201d-like disease, causes cell cycle arrest and B cell death. During the latter process, EBV establishes a persistent infection that can be reactivated to cause B cell growth transformation. The latter process is called \u201ctransformation, \u201d as it allows B cells to acquire the ability to proliferate in the absence of any growth factor. In this paper, we have developed a new system to analyze the expression of the latent antigens in BLs induced by EBV. We show that these viral mutants use a viral promoter previously shown to activate the B cell cycle and to escape apoptosis. We show that this induction is mediated by Wp, a BHRF1 protein that is usually associated with the EBV viral cycle. We find that Wp-driven BHRF1 expression is linked to the presence of W/BHRF1 transcripts and that this is also true for lines transformed in vitro. Furthermore, we show that Wp activity is not needed for BHRF1 expression in the context of transformation and that BHRF1 expression is also linked to Wp-induced B cell growth. Our results thus provide evidence that BHRF1, the EBV Bcl2 homologue, is constitutively expressed as a latent protein in growth-transformed cells in vitro and may contribute to virus-associated lymphomagenesis in vivo."

Stalled pol II then maintains Cp nucleosome depletion. Our data indicate that pTEFb is recruited to Cp by the bromodomain protein Brd4, with polymerase stalling facilitating stable association of pTEFb.

The score based on TG associated SNPs was particularly high among affected individuals compared to non-affected family members.

Here, we describe the construction and characterization of a modified Vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) virus expressing CHIKV E3 and E2 proteins ( MVA-CHIK ) that protected several mouse models from challenge with CHIKV. In particular, BALB/c mice were completely protected against viremia upon challenge with CHIKV after two doses of MVA-CHIK. Additionally, A129 mice ( deficient in IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 ) were protected from viremia, footpad swelling, and mortality. While high anti-virus antibodies were elicited, low or undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies were produced in both mouse models. Furthermore, depletion of CD4+, but not CD8+ T-cells from vaccinated mice resulted in 100% mortality, implicating the indispensable role of CD4+ T-cells in the protection afforded by MVA-CHIK. Our results challenge the assumption that only neutralizing antibodies are effective in providing protection against CHIKV, and provides a framework for the development of novel, more effective vaccine strategies to combat CHIKV."

However, while serotonin has been linked to value-based decision-making, its role in learning is less clear, with acute manipulations often producing inconsistent results. Here, we show that when the effects of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor are studied over longer timescales, learning is robustly improved. We measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) in volunteers as they performed a concurrent appetitive and aversive learning task. We found that 2 weeks of citalopram enhanced reward and effort learning signals in a widespread network of brain regions. At a behavioral level, this was accompanied by more robust reward learning. This suggests that serotonin can modulate the ability to learn via a mechanism that is independent of stimulus valence. Our results highlight both a specific function in learning for serotonin and the importance of studying its role across longer timescales."

In this study, we developed a quantitative model of a gene's expression pattern as a function of its enhancer environment. Our model does not require any prior knowledge about enhancers contributing toward a gene's expression. We used our model to analyze the expression patterns of 27 genes in the Drosophila embryo and identified several examples of genes with strikingly similar expression patterns. We find that the model-selected enhancers for each gene overlap strongly with their experimentally characterized enhancers. We also show that our model predicts the effects of altering enhancer activity on the target genes. Finally, we analyzed whether and why our model assumes enhancer independence was necessary for the genes we studied. We found a deterioration of expression when binding sites in one enhancer were allowed to influence the readout of another enhancer. Thus, interference between enhancer activities was a possible factor that could be important in our model."

TLE4-T splicing is normally repressed in somatic cells because of a weak 5\u2032 splice site and surrounding splicing-repressive intronic regions. We show that TLE4-T RNA pulls down Tra2\u03b2 and hnRNP G proteins which activate its inclusion. The germ cell-specific RBMY and hnRNP G-T proteins were more efficient stimulating TLE4-T incorporation than somatically expressed hnRNP G protein. Tra2\u03b2 bound moderately to TLE4-T RNA, but more strongly to upstream sites to potently activate alternative 3\u2032 splice sites normally weakly selected in the testis. The germ cell-specific RBMY and hnRNP G-T proteins function as efficient germ cell-specific splicing co-activators of TLE4-T.

Mutations in this hotspot disrupt a degron, a signal for the regulation of protein degradation, and lead to the accumulation of SETBP1 protein. Overlapping SETBP1 hotspot mutations have been observed in leukemia. Here we collected clinical information of SGS patients and of four individuals with a milder phenotype caused by de novo germline mutations adjacent to the SETBP1 hotspot. Different mutations within and around the SETBP1 hotspot have varying effects on SETBP1 stability and protein levels in vitro and in silico modeling. We found that the presence of a deleterious mutation in one of the SETBP1 hotspot residues, D868, leads to the largest increase in protein levels. Individuals with germline mutations affecting D868 have enhanced cell proliferation in vitro and higher incidence of cancer compared to patients with other germline SETBP1 mutations. Our findings substantiate that, despite their overlap, somatic SETBP1 mutations driving malignancy are more disruptive to the degron than germline SETBP1 mutations causing SGS.

A total of 79 novel 15-mer T-cell epitopes on the HTNV glycoprotein were identified, among which 20 peptides were dominant target epitopes. Our results show that CD4+T-cell responses to HTNV infection were characterized by both Th1 and ThGranzyme B+ cell responses. The HTNV glycoprotein-specific CD4+T-cell responses inversely correlated with the plasma HTNV RNA load in patients. Individuals with milder disease outcomes showed broader epitopes targeted and stronger CD4+T-cell responses against HTNV glycoproteins compared with more severe patients. The CD4+T cells characterized by broader antigenic repertoire, stronger polyfunctional responses, better expansion capacity and highly differentiated effector memory phenotype ( CD27-CD28-CCR7-CD45RA-CD127hi ) would elicit greater defense against HTNV infection and lead to much milder outcome of the disease.

These proteins are called placental chondroids and, in placental malaria, the binding of the placental microvascular proteoglycan ( CSPG ) to the placental chondroid is mediated by the VAR2CSA protein. We show that in placental microvilli, the interaction of the VAR2CSA protein with the chondroid results in the attachment of several CSPGs to the chondroid. We also show that the different CSPGs, present on placental microvilli, may be functionally relevant to study placental malaria. Finally, we show that the placental chondroid, BeWO, is the main receptor for the VAR2CSA protein and that this interaction is important for its function.

In this paper, we describe a new method, which combines a disparate collection of rare variants with low penetrance. Our method does not require the rare variants to be adjacent in location. Extensive simulations demonstrate the power of our method over other published methods, including the collapsing and weighted-collapsing strategies. We apply our method to a cohort of 289 individuals at the extremes of Body Mass Index distribution.

The rare Coverage analysis identifies one region that is significantly associated with the expression of the two genes.

We have found that the endosomal adaptor protein AP-3 regulates the timing and magnitude of inflammasome activation by detecting the presence of membrane particles in phagosomes. Inflammasome activation is delayed in the absence of AP-3, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and to the expression of autophagy induction and the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Inflammasome activation is also inhibited in mice lacking the autophagy machinery. In addition, mice lacking AP-3 expression exhibit higher mortality and produce less IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and IL-17 than controls upon oral infection with Salmonella Typhimurium.

Methylation of the 3\u2032 ends of piRNAs and sRNAs by the methyltransferase HEN1 protects these sRNAs from degradation. There is a noticeable selection in bilaterian animals against miRNA-mRNA perfect matching, as it leads to the degradation of miRNAs. Cnidarians ( sea anemones, corals, hydroids and jellyfish ), are separated from bilaterians by more than 600 million years.

Moreover, knockdown experiments of Nematostella Dicer1 and PIWI2, homologs of major bilateral bioogenesis components of miRNAs and piRNAs, resulted in developmental arrest similar to HEN1 morphants.

Our results show that the precision of the estimate improves with increasing sequencing depth, which is one of the alternative NGS biomarkers. The full advantage of deep NGS is utilized with continuous diversity measures such as average pairwise distance or site entropy, rather than the fraction of polymorphic sites in Sanger sequences, which is one of the alternative NGS biomarkers.

Although the effects of this process on the genome are well documented, very little is known about the extent of this process in the human genome. Here, we use computational and experimental approaches to show that the chimpanzee genome has a much higher degree of deletion of regions of the genome than the human genome. These deletions correspond to the human-specific loss of a region of the genome. We also find evidence that some of the deletions in the chimpanzee genome are likely the result of a human-specific deletion process. Our results suggest that some human genes may be \u201cat risk\u201d of the human-specific deletion process, which may ultimately result in human disease."

Murine models are very important for understanding the interaction between parasite and the immune system and for developing new therapeutic approaches. In this study, we investigated the impact of acute T. cruzi infection on the development of regulatory T cells, known as tTregs, and the effect of infection on their function. We confirmed that T. cruzi infection leads to a loss of tTregs. At the same time, the number of tTregs was also reduced. Moreover, we also found that the increased expression of a marker gene, CD25, and that migration-associated molecules ( MAVs ) were affected. Collectively, our data indicate that the functional T cell compartment is altered during acute T. cruzi infection and that the immune system is compromised."

This response includes activation of two additional innate immune signaling pathways, which together inform the host cell of the pathogen. We also show that the T3SS pore is required for host cell recognition of the virulence-associated Y. pseudotuberculosis T3SS.

There are two hypotheses as to the origin of this balance. One assumes that it results from a stable mechanism of cortical excitation and inhibition. The second hypothesis thus does account for the balance of transient inputs. However, it remains unclear what mechanism underlies the fine tuning required for balanced feed forward excitation and inhibition. We investigate this issue in the framework of a model characterizing the temporal anti-synaptic Hebbian plasticity. Our analysis shows that inhibitory Hebbian plasticity generates \u2018negative feedback\u2019 that balances excitation and inhibition, which contrasts with the \u2018positive feedback\u2019 of excitatory Hebbian synaptic plasticity. Our analysis also reveals that the feed forward inhibition is important for the stability of the learning dynamics."

The current drugs used to treat the disease are toxic, expensive, and are susceptible to resistance. New drugs are therefore needed that are more effective against the parasite. The most attractive approach to drug development is to use drugs that are already approved for cancer cells to inhibit their growth and survival. We screened a library of FDA-approved drugs for anti-cancer activity against E. multilocularis metacestodes. The first compound was bortezomib, which was used for the treatment of myeloma. The second compound, bortezomib, inhibited the activity of a proteasome, which is a complex of proteins that are involved in the destruction of the cell. Bortezomib inhibited the activity of the proteasome in vitro, and the effect was very similar to that of the antifungal drug chloroquine. However, the effects of bortezomib on the parasite were much more severe than those of chloroquine, and the drug was not well tolerated. In conclusion, bortezomib was identified as a new drug target for E. multilocularis metacestodes. We suggest that this drug may be used in the future to inhibit the growth and replication of E. multilocularis."

The parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a model parasite that can cause a variety of diseases in humans and other animals, and is commonly used for drug screening. Understanding the parasite's biology is essential to further developing new drugs and to developing better vaccines. In this work, we investigate the mechanism of regulation of the parasite's ability to undergo a complex life cycle involving invasion, replication, and egress. We show that the parasite regulates its ability to undergo egress by regulating a novel protein, AKMT, which is localized in the parasite's cytoplasm. AKMT is a protein that binds to the lysine residue at 3 position of a protein ( K ), which is present in all apicomplexan parasites. AKMT regulates the rate of parasite egress, and thus the rate of parasite invasion and exit. Our findings provide novel insight into the regulation of parasite motility and may help develop new drugs and vaccines to treat the infections caused by these parasites."

A combination of immediate, short-, and long-term strategies could substantially improve estimates of dengue disease burden and costs, including eliminating underdetection and underdetection of dengue episodes. In particular, we recommend refining analysis of currently available data to adjust reported episodes and expanding data collection in empirical studies, such as documenting the number of ambulatory visits before and after hospitalization, and using covariates to extrapolate dengue incidence to locations with no or limited reporting. Long-term efforts aim at strengthening capacity to document dengue transmission using serological methods to systematically analyze and relate to epidemiologic data.

Here, we investigated the effects of DR on learning in Caenorhabditis elegans, an important model organism for understanding how cellular changes in response to dietary restriction impact the learning of an organism.

This binding triggers a series of events that lead to the activation of a set of immune cells called neutrophils that are capable of removing the parasite from the body. Neutrophils are important for the immune response to other infections, including tuberculosis, and have been suggested as important immune cells for the control of malaria. In this study, we investigated the activation and function of neutrophils in the blood of malaria patients. We found that neutrophils were activated during the acute episodes of malaria, and that they produced high levels of activation factors such as IFN-\u03b3 and CXCR2, which are important for the control of P. vivax infection.

We performed a large-scale analysis of the genome, which was performed on a cohort of colorectal cancer individuals with a disease onset before 45 years of age. We identified two genes, PTPN12 and LRP6, which were shown to be recurrently affected by rare variants. The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST, encoded by PTPN12, is a regulator of cell motility and LRP6 is a component of the WNT-FZD-LRP5-LRP6 complex that triggers WNT signaling. All variants in LRP6 were identified in individuals with an extremely early-onset of the disease ( \u226430 years of age ). Two of the three variants showed increased Wnt signaling activity in vitro. In conclusion, we present PTPN12 and LRP6 as novel genes contributing to the heterogeneous susceptibility to colorectal cancer."

These diseases are characterized by the formation of insoluble aggregates such as fibrils. Increasing evidence indicates that oligomeric proteins may represent the molecular species responsible for cytotoxicity in a range of neurological disorders including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. To understand how these proteins form and function, we have used computer simulations to reveal the process of oligomerization. We have shown that the process of oligomerization can be divided into two steps: the first is characterised by a hydrophobic coalescence resulting in the formation of molten oligomers in which hydrophobic residues are sequestered away from the solvent. The second step is catalyzed by interchain hydrogen bonding interactions that induce the formation of \u03b2 sheet rich assemblies in which hydrophobic groups can become exposed. Our results show that the process of aggregation into either ordered or amorphous species is largely determined by a competition between the hydrophobicity of the amino acid sequence and the tendency of polypeptide chains to form complexes. Our results offer an explanation for recent observations concerning the cytotoxicity of oligomeric species formed prior to mature amyloid fibrils."

T. brucei is a unicellular parasite that has an unusual life cycle in which the sexual stage is replaced by a dormant liver stage. The parasite has two sets of two-component systems, T. b and T. cruzi, which are used to modulate the expression of a large number of genes. The genes expressed by the two systems differ only in some degree, but it is not known how the two systems work together. We have studied the functional potential of genes expressed in both T. b and T. cruzi, and discovered that genes expressed in T. b are functionally linked to genes expressed in T. cruzi. This suggests that the genes expressed in T. b and T. cruzi are functionally linked. We also investigated the function of genes expressed in T. brucei genome in relation to the regulation of their expression and discovered that genes expressed in T. b are likely to be involved in regulation of the expression of genes that are involved in the control of cellular functions. Our results provide new insights into the functions of genes expressed in T. brucei and provide a new way to study the function of genes in T. brucei."

We recently demonstrated that a peptide ( FBP, 24 amino acids ) of Mycobacterium avium FAP can stimulate strong systemic and mucosal antibody responses when it is used alone or co-administered with other antigens. In the present study, we evaluated the adjuvanticity of a peptide ( FBP, 24 amino acids ) of Mycobacterium avium FAP using a mouse model of AE. We show that the peptide ( rEm-TSP3-FBP ) induces an increased IgG1/IgG2\u03b1 ratio, while the peptide ( rEm-TSP3+CpG ) causes a rapid Th1 response that later shifts to a Th2 response. Immunization with rEm-TSP3-FBP can induce strong systemic and mucosal antibody responses in immunized mice, suggesting that fusion of Em-TSP3 with FBP is a novel, prospective strategy for developing safe and efficient human mucosal vaccines against alveolar echinococcosis."

Two individuals have balanced translocations that disrupt NFIA. All five individuals exhibit similar CNS malformations consisting of a thin, hypoplastic, or absent corpus callosum, and hydrocephalus or ventriculomegaly. The majority of these individuals also exhibit Chiari type I malformation, tethered spinal cord, and urinary tract defects that include vesichydria and acute renal defects.

Our data reveal that Sirt6 occupancy is tightly coupled to the epistatic function of NF-\u03baB in gene expression and its relocalization is largely driven by the NF-\u03baB subunit RelA. We further show that Sirt6 and NF-\u03baB can physically relocalize to DNA, and that several of the target genes of Sirt6 are only revealed upon stress. We integrate these results and find that the epistatic effect of Sirt6 on gene expression is dependent on its physical interaction with the transcription factor RelA.

We also calculated a weighted allele score ( WAS ), which is a weighted prediction of height for each individual based on the previously estimated effect sizes of the common variants in the overall population. The results at the extremes are consistent with a large number of models incorporating either rare genetic non-additive or rare non-genetic factors that decrease height.

We isolated rare AmB-resistant clinical isolates and investigated the mutations that confer resistance in vitro. We found that mutations that confer resistance simultaneously created a variety of stresses that required high levels of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 for survival, even in the absence of AmB. This requirement stems from severe internal stresses caused by the mutations, which dramatically diminished tolerance to external stresses from the host. AmB-resistant mutants were hypersensitive to oxidative stress, febrile temperatures, and killing by neutrophils and also had defects in filamentation and tissue invasion. Thus, the costs of evolving resistance to AmB limit the emergence of this phenotype in the clinic.

However, it can also be achieved through horizontal gene transfer that brings new genes into the network. Here, we investigate the ability of a network with a complex metabolic network to adapt to mutations and to evolve new functions. We show that the network can adapt to mutations through mutations that increase the fitness of the network. We also show that, despite having the same phenotype, the network can easily evolve new functions through mutations of different genotypes. Our results suggest that the robustness of metabolic networks, as well as the design of antimetabolic drugs, can be improved by small molecule compounds that target metabolic networks."

However, the impact of mRNA stability and the dynamic nature of mRNA dynamics have largely remained unexplored, thereby hindering the ability of existing approaches to identify putative co-regulated genes. Here, we introduce a new similarity metric called lead-lag R2 that successfully accounts for the properties of gene dynamics, including varying mRNA degradation and delays. Using yeast cell-cycle time-series gene expression data, we demonstrate that the predictive power of lead-lag R2 for the identification of co-regulated genes is significantly higher than that of standard similarity measures, thus allowing the selection of a large number of entirely new putatively co-regulated genes."

Therefore, a fast, sensitive and cost-effective assay for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis is required. In this study, we developed two new molecular approaches for a more cost-effective diagnosis of histoplasmosis. One of the new approaches, Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification ( LAMP ), is a novel assay targeting the Internal Transcribed Spacer ( ITS ) region of Histoplasma capsulatum. The sensitivity was evaluated using 26 bone marrow and 1 whole blood samples from patients suspected to have histoplasmosis and 5 whole blood samples from healthy subjects. A heparin-containing whole blood sample from a heathy subject was spiked with H. capsulatum cells and directly assayed with no previous DNA extraction. Both assays were able to detect down to 1 fg/\u03bcL of H. capsulatum DNA, and ITS LAMP results could also be revealed to the naked-eye by adding SYBR green to the reaction tube. In comparison with Hcp100 nPCR, both assays reached 83% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Furthermore, ITS LAMP assay showed no need for DNA extraction, since it could be directly applied to crude whole blood samples, with a limit of detection of 10 yeasts/\u03bcL. ITS LAMP and nPCR assays have the potential to be used in conjunction with culture for early diagnosis of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis, allowing earlier, appropriate treatment of the patient."

CPV was first identified in 1971 in the US and it has since caused parvovirus disease in domestic cats. In the 1970s, CPV emerged as a new pandemic pathogen of dogs. In this study, we have investigated how the evolution of CPV over time has influenced its host range. We found that CPV is dominant in natural carnivore species, but only a few mutations were found in viruses from other species. These viruses were selected for by passage in different hosts, and the effect of the mutations varied depending on the host species and the virus background. Our results demonstrate that the evolution of a virus, including how long it has been circulating and in which hosts, as well as its phylogenetic background, determines its host range."

When transinfected into Ae. aegypti, the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia has recently been shown to inhibit replication of DENVs, CHIKV, malaria parasites and filarial nematodes, providing a potentially powerful biocontrol strategy for human pathogens. Because the extent of pathogen reduction can be influenced by the strain of bacterium, we examined whether the wMel strain of Wolbachia influenced CHIKV and YFV infection in Ae. aegypti. Following exposure to viremic blood meals, CHIKV infection and dissemination rates were significantly reduced in mosquitoes with the wMel strain of Wolbachia compared to Wolbachia-uninfected controls. However, similar rates of infection and dissemination were observed in wMel-infected and non-infected Ae. aegypti when intrathoracic inoculation was used to deliver virus. YFV infection, dissemination and replication were similar in wMel-infected and control mosquitoes following intrathoracic inoculation. In contrast, mosquitoes with the wMelPop strain of Wolbachia showed at least a 104 times reduction in YFV RNA copies compared to controls. The extent of reduction in virus infection depended on Wolbachia strain, titer and strain of the virus, and mode of exposure. Our results indicate that Wolbachia is a promising biocontrol strategy for dengue and yellow fever viruses and can be applied for the control of other mosquito-borne viruses."

In Drosophila melanogaster, RSF is involved in chromatin assembly and in remodeling of the chromatin structure. However, the biological significance of RSF in vivo remained unknown. Using the dRsf-1 ( dRsf-1 ) mutant, which was generated by knocking down the level of RSF protein, we found that RSF is required for the remodeling of the chromatin structure.

The bacterial pathogen Neisseria meningitidis can colonize the nasopharynx and the bloodstream of its human host. We show that a repressor protein of N. meningitidis, named natR, binds to simple DNA sequences ( operators ) flanking the phase variable region, which can influence the abundance of different promoter variants. The repressor is itself regulated by another transcription factor, natR. NatR represses the expression of the repressor promoter at the level of transcription, and at the same time represses the expression of a different set of promoter variants. The repressor activity is inhibited by a small molecule, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, which is secreted by N. meningitidis and may play a role in the host response to this environment. We show that NatR represses N. meningitidisnatR promoter by inhibiting DNA binding, and that NatR-dependent repression may be induced during colonization of the mucosa where it plays a major role in the successful adhesion and invasion of the mucosa. Thus, simple DNA sequences in promoter regions may be a strategy used by host-adapted bacterial pathogens to randomly switch between expression states that may nonetheless be induced by appropriate niche-specific signals."

Accurately describing this immunological process requires a fundamental understanding of how the mechanisms of boosting and cross-reactivity respond to repeated infections. We developed a mechanistic model capturing both past infections and subsequent antibody responses. We estimated parameters of the model using cross-sectional antibody titres to nine different strains spanning 40 years of influenza A circulation in southern China. We found that \u201cantigenic seniority\u201d and quickly decaying cross-reactivity were important components of the immune response, suggesting that the order in which individuals were infected with influenza strains shaped observed neutralisation titres to a particular virus. We also obtained estimates of the frequency and age distribution of influenza infection, which indicate that although infections became less frequent as individuals progressed through childhood and young adults, they occurred at similar rates for individuals above age 30 y. Our results highlight the need for longitudinal samples that are tested against multiple historical strains. This could lead to a better understanding of how, over the course of a lifetime, fast, transient antibody dynamics combine with the longer-term immune responses considered here."

Our computer models, however, do not take into account the spatial, or temporal, variation of the system under study. We use a simple statistical framework to consider how local, junction-level optimality ( J optimization ) principles might be used to predict the structure of the human head and torso, and compare it with experimental data.

BER and T BER are responsible for the removal of uracil from DNA. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, mutations in the UNG gene, which encodes a DNA glycosylase, result in uracil accumulation in genomic DNA. Because the lack of UNG in all other organisms has been shown to cause severe developmental defects, it is crucial to understand how the UNG gene functions to remove uracil from DNA. Here we show that the level of uracil in the genomic DNA of Drosophila melanogaster larvae is much higher than in the Drosophila imaginal tissues, and that this level is higher in tissues of Drosophila imago. We also show that the silencing of dUTPase, the major DNA repair enzyme in Drosophila, in the DNA of Drosophila larvae causes strong lethality at the early pupal stages, indicating that tolerance of highly uracil-substituted DNA is also stage-specific. We show that dUTPase is also required for the physiological pattern of uracil\u2013DNA accumulation in Drosophila and that dUTPase silencing in Drosophila and other Holometabola insects causes a strongly lethal phenotype in early pupal stages.

In this study, we demonstrated that sepsis infection impairs the ability of NK-cells to effectively respond to viral ligands and infections. This effect was mediated by sepsis-induced impairment in the expression of the activating Ly49H receptor, which recognizes the murine cytomegalovirus ( MCMV ) m157 protein. This receptor was also overexpressed in NK-cells and impaired their ability to effectively respond to viral ligands and infections. Finally, as a consequence of sepsis-dependent numerical and functional lesions in Ly49H+ NK-cells, host capacity to control MCMV infection was significantly impaired. Importantly, IL-2 complex therapy after septic infection restored numbers but not a function of NK-cells leading to enhanced immunity to MCMV challenge. Thus, sepsis-induced immunoparalysis state includes numerical and NK-cell-intrinsic functional impairments, an instructive notion for future studies aimed at restoring NK-cell immunity in septic survivors."

Loss of function of ZLL in ago1 mutants re-establishes both siRNA and miRNA pathways for a subset of AGO1 target genes.

HP1 is typically thought to act as a transcriptional suppressor of gene expression by forming complexes with other proteins that act as repressors. Here, we used the powerful genetic method of Drosophila to identify the sites of HP1 binding on chromosomes. We found that HP1 binds to different types of chromatin on chromosome arms and that it is typically associated with genes that are active and/or repressed. Our results show that HP1 can form complexes with several different types of chromatin. We also show that this activity is dependent on histone modification and that the histone variant H3. 3 is the most important mark for active chromatin. Interestingly, we found that the expression level of HP1 changes dramatically in response to the histone variant H3. 3. Thus, we conclude that HP1 can be involved in transcriptional repression by regulating its binding to chromatin. These results show that HP1 binds to several types of chromatin and has extensive links with several other chromatin components."

Here we describe for the first time, the three genetic modifications that allow budding yeast cells to survive without telomere capping by Cdc13. We show that cdc13 is required for the viability of budding yeast cells lacking Sgs1, Exo1, and Rad9, three DNA damage response proteins, and show that RecQ helicases are required for this process. Strikingly, when the recombinant strains are grown indefinitely, cdc13 is no longer required for the viability of these cells.

We found that paralogous human-yeast complementation assays could be used to identify disease variants in genes not shared orthologous sequences. Because complementation assays are powerful predictors of pathogenic variation, they are available for only a few percent of human disease genes. Here we systematically examine the question of whether complementation assays based on paralogous relationships can expand the number of human disease genes with functional variant detection assays. We found that complementation can often identify pathogenic variants outside the homologous sequence region, presumably because of global effects on protein folding or stability. Within our search space, paralog-based complementation more than doubled the number of human disease genes with a yeast-based complementation assay for disease variation."

Although it is known that osteoblasts regulate the expression of FN, there is limited knowledge of how osteoblasts regulate cells of the immune system. Here, we show that a specific isoform of FN, e. g., extracellular domain A ( EDA ) -FN, increases the expression of arginase-1 in myeloid-derived cells, resulting in increased cancer growth. We show that this beneficial effect can be reduced by inhibiting the integrin \u03b15\u03b21 receptor or by interfering with the fibrotic tissue formation in a fibrosis model. We show that the expression of arginase-1 is normally beneficial in wound healing, and that EDA-FN protects against excessive fibrosis in a fibrosis model.

Patients with REST\u2013less tumors had significantly worse prognosis, and were significantly more likely to develop recurrence within the first 3 years after diagnosis.

We used high-content imaging and a human monocytic cell line to screen 1, 201 fungal mutants for strains with altered host interactions and identified multiple genes that influence fungal adherence and phagocytosis. One of these genes was PFA4, which encodes a protein S-acyl transferase ( PAT ), one of a family of DHHC domain-containing proteins that catalyzes lipid modification of proteins. Deletion of PFA4 caused dramatic defects in cryptococcal morphology, stress tolerance, and virulence. Bioorthogonal palmitoylome-profiling identified Pfa4-specific protein substrates involved in cell wall synthesis, signal transduction, and membrane trafficking responsible for these phenotypic alterations. We demonstrate that a single PAT is responsible for the modification of a subset of proteins that are critical in cryptococcal pathogenesis.

We have identified a novel pathway of T. gondii infection of primary human peripheral blood monocytes that is mediated by a Syk-CARD9-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Syk was rapidly phosphorylated during T. gondii infection of primary human monocytes, and inhibition of Syk reduced IL-1\u03b2 production and the production of pro-IL-1\u03b2. Furthermore, inhibition of PKC\u03b4, CARD9/MALT-1 and IKK reduced IL-1\u03b2 levels and the production of pro-IL-1\u03b2 during T. gondii infection. Genetic ablation of PKC\u03b4 or CARD9 in THP-1 cells also reduced IL-1\u03b2 levels and IL-1\u03b2 release during T. gondii infection. Thus, Syk functions upstream of this NF-\u03baB-dependent signaling pathway for IL-1\u03b2 transcriptional activation. IL-1\u03b2 release from T. gondii-infected primary human monocytes required the NLRP3-caspase-1 inflammasome, but interestingly, was independent of gasdermin D ( GSDMD ) cleavage and pyroptosis. Moreover, IL-1\u03b2 levels and IL-\u03b2 release from T. gondii-infected primary human monocytes were indistinguishable from those of wild-type THP-1 cells.

However, western Turkic peoples sampled across Eurasia shared an excess of long chromosomal tracts that are identical by descent ( IBD ) with populations from present-day South Siberia and Mongolia ( SSM ), a region where ancestors of the Turkic peoples of the Siberians are present. While SSM matching IBD tracts are also observed in non-Turkic populations, Turkic peoples demonstrate a higher percentage of such tracts ( p-values \u2264 0. 01 ) compared to their non-Turkic neighbors. Thus, our results indicate historical admixture among Turkic peoples, and the recent shared ancestry with modern SSM populations supports one of the hypothesized homelands for their nomadic nomadic Turkic and related Mongolic ancestors."

Genetic constraint, however, is a pervasive feature of biological systems, and it is a challenge to account for it in quantitative trait mapping. Here, we describe a new way to identify genetic constraints in a QTL analysis of a well-studied trait, the response of Boechera stricta to the seasonal environment. By examining over 500, 000 QTL in six different environments, we show that the genetic constraint and the response to the environment depend on the environment and on the genetic background. We then show that a specific genetic restriction, the effect of genomic background epistasis, can also affect the effects of the genetic background on the response to the environment. Our results suggest that genetic constraints and environmental interactions may be coupled in a quantitative trait mapping framework by taking into account the effect of genetic constraint, or the effect of genetic constraint."

The cilium is a simple tube, made of a linear array of rod-like cells that are lined by a layer of membrane, called the endocytosis canal. Endocytosis is an important process in many animal cells, including the immune system and the cardiovascular system, and defects in this process lead to a wide range of diseases. Cilia are unique among animal cells in that they are made of only one type of cell and are therefore very easily accessible to imaging techniques. We have discovered a new gene, DLK-1, that regulates the length of cilia in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that DLK-1 is a key component of a pathway that regulates the amount of RAB-5, a key component of the endocytosis machinery. Loss of this pathway results in reduced levels of RAB-5 and also of RAB-5-associated proteins involved in endocytosis. Our results suggest that cilia function in animals is regulated by a pathway involving the RAB-5 and DMEK-1, which are components of a multi-protein complex."

High phenotypic plasticity in laying date has allowed many bird species to track the increasingly early springs resulting from recent environmental change, but although changes in the timing of reproduction have been well studied in birds, these questions have only recently been addressed in mammals. To track peak resource availability, large herbivores like roe deer, with a widespread distribution across Europe, should also modify their life-history schedule in response to changes in vegetation phenology over time. In this study, we analysed the impact of climate change on the timing of roe deer birth dates and the consequences for population demography and individual fitness. Our study provides a rare quantification of the demographic costs associated with the failure of a species to modify its phenology in response to a changing world. Given these fitness costs, the lack of response of roe deer birth dates to match the timing of parturition is in stark contrast with the marked phenotypic responses to climate change observed in many other mammals. We suggest that the lack of phenotypic plasticity in roe deer birth dates is linked to its inability to track environmental cues of variation in resource availability for the timing of parturition."

In roots, the interaction between ethylene and ABA pathway is different from that reported in Arabidopsis, where ethylene-mediated root inhibition is independent of ABA function. In capsule plant, ethylene-mediated root inhibition is also mediated by the ethylene receptor, which is involved in ethylene signaling.

CMV has evolved mechanisms to replicate in the nucleus, the site of viral DNA synthesis, in a way that is highly conserved among herpesviruses. HCMV UL70 protein, which is believed to encode the primase activity of the viral DNA replication machinery, is an essential component of the viral replication machinery. Here, we provide evidence that UL70 specifically interacts with a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed member of the heat shock protein Hsp40/DNAJ family, DNAJB6a and DNAJB6b, which is expressed as two isoforms, a and b, in the nucleus. UL70 interacts with DNAJB6a and DNAJB6b in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. The nuclear import of UL70 was increased in cells in which DNAJB6a was up-regulated or DNAinely decreased, and was reduced in cells in which DNA cleanly6a was down-regulated or DNAinely decreased. Furthermore, the level of viral DNA synthesis and progeny production was increased in cells in which DNAMessenger was up-regulated or DNAessenger was down-regulated. Our results suggest that the relative expression levels of DNAJB6 isoforms may play a key role in regulating the cellular localization of UL70, leading to modulation of HCMV DNA synthesis and lytic infection."

In this study, we have developed a novel mouse model of PRS. We show that all three mutations, including one in the PAX2/Pax2 domain, lead to hypomorphic alleles of PAX2/Pax2 in vivo. These mutations disrupt hydrogen bonds in atomic models and cause reduced Pax2 transactivation, but do not affect nuclear localization, steady-state mRNA levels, or the ability of Pax2 to bind its DNA consensus sequence. Furthermore, these mutations show reduced steady-state levels of Pax2 protein in vitro and ( for p. T74A ) in vivo, likely by reducing protein stability.

We focus on 24 proteins of two large complexes: the RNA polymerase II and the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ).

Unexpectedly, we find that the architecture of the complexes in F1 hybrids could not be distinguished from that of the parental species.

We found that snail population density and prevalence of FZT metacercariae were determined in the Red River Delta area. We found a significant positive correlation between prevalence of FZT metacercariae and snail population density. However, some ponds with few infected snails were also collected and had high prevalence and intensity of FZT in juvenile fish. This may be due to immigration of cercariae into the pond from external water sources. The total number and density of potential host snails and density of host snails infected with heterophyid trematodes in the aquaculture pond is a useful predictor for infections in juvenile fish, although infection levels in juvenile fish can occur despite low density or absence infected snails. This suggests that control programs to control FZT infection in fish should include not only intra-pond snail control, but also include water sources of allochthonous cercariae, i. e. canals supplying water to ponds as well as snail habitats outside the pond such as rice fields and surrounding ponds."

Chlamydia are obligate intracellular pathogens that replicate in special membrane bound compartments, and have evolved strategies to manipulate host cell signaling pathways by targeting proteins involved in these compartments. Recently, several Rab proteins have been shown to be important for Chlamydia development and host cell trafficking. Here we show that two Rab proteins, Rab6 and Rab11, are necessary and sufficient to promote Chlamydia-induced Golgi fragmentation. Rab6 and Rab11 were shown to be required for Chlamydia-induced Golgi disruption, and hence Golgi fragmentation, and they were shown to be required for Chlamydia-induced Golgi fragmentation. Rab6 and Rab11 were also shown to be required for Golgi matrix components Golgin-84 and p115. Deletion of either Rab6 or Rab11 blocked Chlamydia-induced Golgi fragmentation, whereas Golgi fragmentation was unaffected in cells lacking p115. Interestingly, Golgi fragmentation could rescue Chlamydia-induced Golgi disruption in Rab6 and Rab11 knockdown cells. Our results support the notion that Chlamydia subverts Golgi structure to enhance its intracellular development."

First, we showed that the optimal design principle can be captured as a Pareto optimal that can be used to optimize the performance of the plant. Second, we identified small sets of genes that can be mutated to shift the weight prioritizing one objective over the other. Third, we showed that the weight feature that we used to identify optimal genes is significantly less variable across replicates of the same genotype compared to other common plant traits.

Standard statistical techniques have difficulty dealing with undetected proteins. We propose a mixture model that takes into account both detected and non-detected proteins. Non-detected proteins are classified either as ( a ) proteins that are not expressed in at least one replicate, or ( b ) proteins that are expressed but are below the limit of detection. We obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the mixture model, including the group-specific probability of expression and mean expression intensities.

The honeybee ( Apis mellifera ) employs a special pathway consisting of two complementary sex determiners, sex-determining genes ( csd ) and sex-determining genes ( fem ), to determine the sex. The honeybee's ability to switch from one sex to the other depends on the activity of the sex-determining gene ( ds ) located on Chromosome 3 and the master regulator of the sex determination pathway, Fem. Fem activity is also required to maintain the sex-determining pathway throughout development. We show that the sex-determining gene is required to induce the female pathway, while the feminizer ( fem ) gene is essential to maintain the pathway throughout development. We also show that the feminizer is necessary to maintain the female pathway during the development of the bee. Finally, we show that the Fem protein is regulated by a positive feedback mechanism, wherein Fem activity is induced by splicing of fem mRNA transcripts. Fem protein is also required to control the splicing of conserved male- and female-specific transcription factors that are involved in sexual differentiation.

In Drosophila, the spatiotemporal modulation of Sex combs reduced ( Scr ) expression within the first thoracic ( T1 ) leg is required for the generation of segment- and sex-specific sense organ patterns. Scr is a master regulator of the posterior bristle pattern, and here we show that it also controls the expression of the Distalless and Engrailed homeodomain transcription factors that act through sequences in its regulatory elements. Our results suggest that the enhancer function of Scr is necessary for the formation of T1-specific bristle patterns and sex combs. We show that the Distalless and Engrailed homeodomain transcription factors act through sequences in this enhancer to establish elevated Scr expression in spatially defined domains. This enhancer functions to integrate Scr into the intrasegmental gene regulatory network, such that Scr serves as a link between leg patterning, sex determination, and sensory organ development."

We therefore sequenced the MITF gene and found a 10 bp insertion near MITF. We then sequenced the MITF promoter variant in all other horses from the studied family, and found a 10 bp insertion near MITF in unrelated horses.

We used an animal model to study the effect of rhinovirus infection on immune responses. We focused on rhinovirus-induced neutrophil chemoattractants expression that is essential for bacterial clearance. Mice infected with rhinovirus showed bacteria up to 72 h post-infection. However, mice in rhinovirus infected lung and lung alveolar macrophages showed reduced neutrophil recruitment and chemokine levels. We also showed that rhinovirus infection interferes with the degradation of the innate immune protein, IRAK-1. Inhibition of rhinovirus-induced IRAK-1 degradation restored neutrophil recruitment and chemokine levels. Based on these observations, we speculate that modulation of innate immune responses by rhinovirus may predispose the host to secondary bacterial infection, particularly in patients with underlying chronic respiratory disorders."

During latency, the virus infects B cells and the B cell transcription factor BZLF1 ( Z ) activates the expression of two viral proteins that are critical to the lytic replication process. A unique feature of Z is its ability to bind to methylated forms of the BZLF1 promoter, which is called the \u201cmethylated\u201d form.

These residues are required for Z to activate the methylated form of the BZLF1 promoter. Z also activates the expression of the viral gene only when both of these residues are present. We also show that Z can directly bind to the methylated form of the BZLF1 promoter, and that methylation-dependent activation of the promoter is required. Our studies provide evidence that Z is able to activate methylated forms of the BZLF1 promoter and that the methylated form is critical for its activation.

This condition is called viral quiescence or dormancy, and it is known to be associated with several human diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and immunodeficiency. The viral genome is packaged into a virion, which is composed of viral and host proteins. Virion packaging is initiated at the level of the host cell nucleus, which is usually located in a cell-derived compartment termed the endoribonuclease-associating compartment. Virion assembly is then transported to the cell surface where it can be integrated into the host cell, a process known as viral gene expression. Virion host shutoff is an effective means of viral gene expression, allowing the host to limit the replication of the virus while simultaneously stimulating the production of proteins that are needed for viral gene expression. We have discovered that the activity of the viral endoribonuclease vhs is required for the control of the infected cell transcriptome, which in turn is linked to the production of late proteins, a class of proteins that are associated with viral gene expression. Our findings reveal that vhs and its co-factors act to regulate the cellular transcriptome to facilitate the production of late proteins."

IFN-I is a cytokine that has been shown to be a signature of innate immunity and to be produced by specialized \u201cinterferon-producing cell\u201d ( IPC ) that has been shown to belong to the lineage of plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ). We addressed this question by studying infections of mice with the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. IFN-I was detected in mice infected with L. monocytogenes, but not in mice infected with a non-pDC precursor. Both IFN-I and IFNAR were necessary for IFN-I production. Our data indicate that the IFN-I receptor and the transcription factor IRF7 are responsible for IFN-I synthesis in pDC. In contrast, IFN-I production in mice infected with L. monocytogenes was determined to be predominantly produced by myeloid cells. Furthermore, IFN-I levels in the spleen from infected mice were inversely correlated to the resistance to lethal infection. Based on these data, we propose that the engagement of pDC, the mode of IFN-I mobilization, and the shaping of the innate immune response by IFN-I differ between intracellular pathogens."

The current vaccine is effective in only one-third of the world's population, and the need for an effective vaccine is pressing. The development of an improved vaccine should be a major priority. Immunization with a single dose of phosphoantigen, or a combination of phosphoantigen-specific and other antigens, is necessary for generating a protective immune response. Immunization with a combination of phosphoantigen-specific antigens is also necessary to achieve protection from pulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of immunization with a single or a combination of antigens is essential to the development of an improved vaccine. We report here the important role of V\u03b32V\u03b42 T-cell expansion and differentiation in the development of a protective immune response to tuberculosis. V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cells recognize a lipid component of the cell wall component M. tuberculosis antigen and produce a lipid effector cell response to kill M. tuberculosis. This response is important for protection against tuberculosis in nonhuman primates, and may be a means of developing a vaccine that protects against HIV and tuberculosis."

Research funding for vaccine development has largely considered protection within the biothreat context, but the resulting vaccines could be applicable to populations that are at risk of acquiring melioidosis. Here, we review all current vaccine candidates and studies evaluating their protective potential in animal models. We found a lack of studies using diabetic models, which will be central to any evaluation of a melioidosis vaccine for natural infection. We found that, if vaccination can be considered cost-effective, it may be important to use it in high-risk populations such as diabetic patients. We found that the review systematically summarized all the vaccine candidates and studies in animal models that had evaluated their protective potential. Possible candidates included live attenuated, whole cell killed, sub-unit, plasmid DNA and dendritic cell vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines were not considered favorably because of possible reversion to virulence and hypothetical risk of latent infection.

In a few cases, mutations in the genes that function in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs can cause heart defects and other diseases. However, it is not understood which of the different genes that function in the post-transcriptional modification is important for the development of these diseases. We used the simple model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the effect of mutations in three genes that function in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs. We found that the inactivation of each of the genes causes changes in the expression of mitochondrial stress response genes that are quite different from those caused by the inactivation of the other three genes. Our data suggest that this causes a change in the way that the cell responds to the hypomodification status of mitochondrial tRNAs. The hypomodification status of mitochondrial tRNAs is known to promote a metabolic switch that allows the cell to recover from a metabolic stress, but the hypomodification status of mitochondrial tRNAs also causes a physiological cost. These results support the idea that the pathological state of mitochondrial tRNAs may first develop not as a direct consequence of a metabolic defect, but from the cell\u2019s maladaptive response to the hypomodification status of mitochondrial tRNAs."

The main method for detecting and treating cases of gambiense HAT are active screening through mobile teams and passive detection through self-referral of patients to dedicated treatment centres or hospitals. Strategies based on active case finding and treatment have drastically reduced the global incidence of the disease over recent decades. However, little is known about the impact of passive case detection. We analysed data from the period between active screening sessions in hundreds of villages that were monitored as part of three HAT control projects run by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Southern Sudan and Uganda in the late 1990s and early 2000s. We found heterogeneity in incidence across villages, with a small minority of villages found to have much higher transmission rates and burdens than the majority. We further found that only a minority of prevalent cases in the first, haemo-lymphatic stage of the disease were detected passively, whereas around 50% of patients in the second, meningo-encephalitic were detected. We estimated that passive case detection reduced transmission in affected areas by between 30 and 50%, suggesting that there is great potential value in improving rates of passive case detection. As gambiense HAT is driven towards elimination, it will be important to establish good systems of passive screening, and estimates such as the ones we have here will be of value in assessing the expected impact of moving from a primarily active to a more passive screening regime."

How the multicellular system resists the inevitable noise to acquire developmental reproducibility constitutes a fundamental question in developmental biology. Toward this end, we focused on vertebrate somitogenesis as a representative system, because somites are repeatedly reproduced within a single embryo whereas such reproducibility is lost in segmentation clock gene-deficient embryos. However, the effect of noise on developmental reproducibility has not been fully investigated, because of the technical difficulty in manipulating the noise intensity in experiments. In this study, we developed a computational model of ERK-mediated somitogenesis, in which bistable ERK activity is regulated by an FGF gradient, cell-cell communication, and the segmentation clock, subject to the intrinsic noise. The model simulation generated our previous in vivo observation that the ERK activity was distributed in a stepwise gradient in the presomitic mesoderm, and its boundary was posteriorly shifted by the clock in a stepwise manner, leading to regular somite formation. Here, we showed that this somite regularity was robustly maintained against the noise. Removing the clock from the model predicted that the stepwise shift of the ERK activity occurs at irregular time, owing to the noise, resulting in somite size variation. This model prediction was confirmed by live imaging of ERK activity in zebrafish embryos. Therefore, this study indicates a novel role of the segmentation clock in noise-resistant developmental reproducibility."

High-density microarrays composed of fully overlapped 15mer peptides spanning the entire sequences of 232 non-redundant MASP molecules were screened with chronic Chagasic sera. This strategy led to the identification of 86 antigenic motifs, each one likely representing a single linear B-cell epitope, which were mapped to 69 different MASP polypeptides. In contrast to previous reports, we show that MASP antigenic motifs are restricted to the central and mature regions of MASP molecules, consistent with their intracellular processing. We further evaluated the antigenicity of these motifs and demonstrated their potential role in the development of anti-T. cruzi antibodies. Our data represent the first unbiased, high-resolution profiling of linear B-cell epitopes from MASP molecules during human infection."

While there is evidence for a common frontoparietal network underlying both functions and for a key role of dopamine in the modulation of flexible versus stable behavior, the exact neurocomputational mechanisms underlying those executive functions and their adaptation to environmental demands are still unclear. In this work we study the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying cue based task switching ( flexibility ) and distractor inhibition ( stability ) in a paradigm specifically designed to probe both functions. We develop a physiologically plausible, explicit model of neural networks that maintain the currently active task rule in working memory and implement the decision process. We show that the flexible decision network is able to reproduce behavioral data and predict the individual stability of the rule-representing attractor states in terms of the minimal action associated with a transition between different rule states in the phase-space of the fitted models. Finally, we estimate the subject-specific stability of the rule-representing attractor states in terms of the minimal action associated with a transition between different rule states in the phase-space of the fitted models. This stabilization measure correlates with switching-specific thalamocorticostriatal activation, i. e., with a system associated with flexible working memory updating and dopaminergic modulation of cognitive flexibility. These results show that stochastic dynamical systems can implement the basic computations underlying cognitive stability and flexibility and explain neurobiological bases of individual differences."

Here, we show that by considering network structure and network dynamics as well as the variability of the underlying pathogen phylogenies, we can separate the direct effects of network structure from the underlying pathogen evolution. We find that host contact networks with more heterogeneous structure yield pathogen phylogenies with more variable network structure and shorter network lengths.

In this paper, we use a computational model of the AMP-activated protein kinase to study the mechanism of auto-inhibition of the AMPK homolog. The study shows that the self-inhibitory domain of AMPK adopts an open conformation in the absence of its ligand, while the closed conformation is taken up by mutations that disrupt the auto-inhibitory domain. These findings are in agreement with recent experimental studies and show that mutations that disrupt the interactions between the autoinhibitory domain and the ligand can also affect the structure of the activation loop.

Here, we demonstrate that Spen is required for the proper control of energy balance, which in turn is linked to the control of fat levels. In particular, Spen is required for proper levels of \u03b2-oxidation, an essential metabolic process that is important for cancer. We further demonstrate that Spen is required for appropriate levels of the enzyme Spenico, which counteracts Spen function. Finally, we demonstrate that Spen is required for the proper levels of Spen and Spenico, which are conserved in mammals. Our study provides a molecular context to understand the metabolic defects that arise from Spen dysfunction and suggests that Spen is a key regulator of energy balance."

In this study, we show that PD-L1 and TIGIT are predominantly co-expressed on lymph nodes and regulate HIV-1 transcription in a PD-1/IC-L dependent manner. We also demonstrate that PD-L1 and TIGIT regulate HIV-1 transcription in lymph nodes through PD-1/IC-Land interactions. We further show that PD-1 and TIGIT co-localize on lymph nodes, and that co-culturing LN-microenvironment DCs with PD-1 and Tfh cells significantly increased HIV-1 transcription in vitro.

HPV infects cells through the expression of viral proteins that trigger cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair, but the exact mechanism by which these genes are regulated is largely unknown. We found that the deacetylase SIRT1 is required for efficient viral gene expression and DNA damage repair. SIRT1 binds to multiple sites of the HPV genome and regulates the acetylation of histone H1 and H4. Acetylation of histones is a common feature of the high-risk HPV life cycle, and several reports have implicated SIRT1 as a modulator of this process. In addition, we found that SIRT1 regulates the recruitment of NBS1 and Rad51 to the viral genomes, and this may contribute to regulating viral replication. Our studies provide new insights into how SIRT1 contributes to the regulation of the high-risk HPV life cycle."

When these genetic variants are transmitted to new individuals, they can change the genetic code and cause new diseases. HIV-1 does this by mutating its own genomes and by increasing the rate at which these mutations occur. It is important to know how much of the genetic variation is due to mutations and which mutations are important for the evolution of HIV-1. Here, we show that mutations occurring in the genomes of cells with hypermutated HIV-1 are much more important in generating new HIV-1 viruses than mutations in the genomes of cells with normal HIV-1. In particular, we found that the frequency of mutations that occur in these viruses is much lower than those in normal cells, which is very important for determining how much HIV-1 genetic variation is present in the population. These findings provide important information for future research into how HIV-1 evolution occurs."

These effectors are produced by T6SSs, which are often assembled in a non-competitive manner in response to incoming attacks from neighbouring cells. The T6SS is a contractile nanomachine, and can fire at any time and in any manner, and is deployed by T6SSs in many cases. However, many T6SSs are \u2018offensive\u2019, firing in all cells or on multiple surfaces without the need for an incoming attack. Here, we used the anti-bacterial T6SS of S. marcescens to elucidate the mechanism of T6SS regulation. We show that T6SS assembly is regulated by the negative regulator PpkA, which is activated by the upstream input of the T6SS. PpkA-mediated activation of the TPP pathway is required for spatial reorientation and efficient killing of the T6SS. In contrast, the upstream input of the TPP pathway defines a new periplasmic regulator, RtkS, which interacts with PpkA and can also act as a target for PpkA. We propose a model whereby the opposing actions of the TPP pathway and PpkA ensure efficient spatial re-orientation of the T6SS after firing, providing an opportunity for spatial re-orientation of the T6SS in order to maximise the efficiency of competitor cell targeting."

The most famous member of LAS proteins is Sonic Hedgehog ( ShhN ), which is a member of the Hh proteins. Members of this family have essential roles in animal development, and they are also involved in human disease. One of the defining features of LAS proteins is the ability to bind calcium ions. We have studied the effect of calcium ions on ShhN structure, dynamics, and interactions. We find that the presence of calcium has a marked effect on the overall structure of ShhN. Surprisingly, the binding of the second calcium ion switches the putative catalytic center from a state similar to LAS enzymes to a state that probably is catalytically inactive. We describe in detail the mechanics of the switch, including the effect of calcium on the putative catalytic center. We find that the putative catalytic center is intact and stabilizes the overall structure. We therefore conclude that ShhN could degrade other ShhN molecules by cleavage at highly conserved glycines. To test experimentally the stability of ShhN against autodegradation, we compare two ShhN mutants in vitro: ( 1 ) a ShhN mutant unable to bind calcium but with putative catalytic center intact, and thus, according to our hypothesis, a cannibalistic zinc-peptidase.

We identified several viral RNA-binding sites in the viral capsid protein. One of these sites is in the cytoplasm of SINV-infected cells. We found that the interaction of the capsid protein with genomic RNA is critical for viral growth and virion formation. Furthermore, we found that the interaction site of the capsid protein and genomic RNA is important for the replication of SINV in a mouse model of neurotropic alphavirus infection. Together, the data presented in this report identify novel interactions between the viral capsid protein and the viral RNA during the replication cycle of SINV.

This raises the question\u2014how does the mitochondrial arrangement affect the metabolite distributions within cardiomyocytes and what is its impact on force dynamics? Here, we address this question by employing a computational mesh that combines a detailed model of cardiac bioenergetics with a large set of computer simulations. Our results indicate that heterogeneous mitochondrial distributions can lead to significant spatial variation across the cell in concentrations of inorganic phosphate, creatine and creatine phosphate. However, our model predicts that sufficient activity of the creatine kinase system, coupled with rapid diffusion of inorganic phosphate compounds, maintains near uniform ATP and ADP ratios across the cell cross-section. This suggests that the PCr shuttle and associated enzymatic reactions act to maintain uniform ATP and ADP distributions across the cell. However, our model also predicts that under hypoxia activity of mitochondrial CK enzymes and diffusion of high-energy phosphate compounds may be insufficient to sustain uniform ATP/ADP distribution and hence force generation."

Blood feeding is essential for mosquito development and survival. During blood feeding, the mosquito feeds on the blood stream of an infected host. During the first days of blood feeding, blood feeding stimulates the production of insulin-like peptides ( ILPs ) by the mosquito. These ILPs are released into the blood stream and regulate blood digestion and egg development. In turn, blood feeding stimulates the growth of hemocytes, the primary cell type of mosquito blood cells. Here, we show that blood feeding stimulates the proliferation of hemocytes, which in turn stimulates egg production. We also show that blood feeding stimulates hemocyte growth by stimulating the production of insulin-like peptides 3 ( ILP3 ). Infection studies indicate that blood feeding stimulates the growth of hemocytes and that ILP3 is responsible for this effect. Taken together, our results reveal a novel role for the insulin signaling pathway in regulating hemocyte proliferation. Furthermore, blood feeding enhances resistance to E. coli at lower levels of infection but reduces tolerance at higher levels of infection. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized role for the insulin signaling pathway in regulating hemocyte proliferation."

Virus infection can also induce the upregulation of surface ligands that activate NK cells. Accordingly, the herpesviruses have evolved a diverse array of mechanisms to prevent NK cell engagement of NK-activating ligands on virus-infected cells. Here we demonstrate that the HHV-7 U21 gene product interferes with NK cell recognition. U21 can bind to the NK activating ligand ULBP1 and rer Latterize it to the lysosomal compartment. In addition, U21 downregulates the surface expression of the NK activating ligands MICA and MICB, resulting in a reduction in NK-mediated cytotoxicity.

Our study provides important insight into the mechanism of antibody recognition and reveals a previously unappreciated level of flexibility that can underlie the ability of antibodies to recognize multiple antigens."

In this work, we describe the results of a large-scale screening of a cathepsin inhibitor library against a panel of five parasite cysteine proteases thought to be relevant in tropical parasitic diseases. Compounds active against parasite cysteine proteases were subsequently screened against cultured Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei and/or Trypanosoma cruzi parasites and evaluated for cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. The end products of this effort include the identification of sub-micromolar cell-active leads as well as the elucidation of structure-activity trends that can guide further optimization efforts."

In this study, we utilized a panel of 42 inbred mouse strains and demonstrated that genetic variations in the cornea can influence the response of the endothelium, the main target of blood flow in the circulatory system. We performed a genome-wide association study of 42 strains, mapping five loci on chromosomes 4, 8, 11, 15 and 16. We then evaluated the expression of one of these candidate genes, Padi2, and found that it is associated with a trait known to be involved in the response to high blood pressure. By using a high-throughput assay, we confirmed that Padi2 expression is also associated with the response to low blood pressure in human endothelial cells. We also knocked down Padi2 in zebrafish embryos, and demonstrated that this dosage-dependent effect was partially reversed by human Padi2 mRNA. Our study is the first to identify a new gene responsible for differences in vessel formation in the endothelium and will help to develop new diagnostics and treatments for a wide variety of angiogenesis-dependent diseases."

To understand this process, it is crucial to know which parasite proteins are exported into the host cell. This has been aided by the PEXEL/HT sequence, a five-residue motif found in many exported proteins, leading to the prediction of the exportome. However, several PEXEL/HT negative exported proteins indicate that this exportome is incomplete and it remains unknown if and how much further PNEPs exist. Here we report the identification of new PNEPs in the most virulent malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This includes proteins with a domain structure deviating from previously known PNEPs and suggests unanticipated functions of MSRPs. Analyzing regions mediating export of selected new PNEPs, we show that the first 20 amino acids of PNEPs without a classical N-terminal signal peptide are sufficient to promote export of a reporter, confirming the concept that this is a shared property of all PNEPs of this type. Moreover, we took advantage of newly found soluble PNEPs to show that this type of exported protein requires unfolding to move from the parasitophorous vacuole ( PV ) membrane ( PVM ), highlighting protein translocation in the parasite periphery as a general means in protein export of malaria parasites."

We show that the nif gene cluster is an operon comprising nifB, nifH, nifD, nifK, nifE, nifN, nifX, hesA and nifV and that the nif gene cluster is under the control of a \u03c370 ( \u03c3A ) -dependent promoter located upstream of nifB. To investigate genetic requirements for diazotrophy, we transferred the nif cluster to E. coli. We show that this minimal nif gene cluster is sufficient to enable synthesis of catalytically active nitrogenase in Escherichia coli when expressed either from the native nifB promoter or from the T7 promoter. Deletion analysis indicates that in addition to the core nif genes, hesA plays an important role in nitrogen fixation. Whereas nif transcription in Paenibacillus is regulated in response to nitrogen availability and by the external oxygen concentration, transcription from the nifB promoter is constitutive in E. coli. Our study demonstrates the potential for using a minimal nif gene cluster to engineer nitrogen fixation in a non-nitrogen fixing organism with a minimal set of nine nif genes."

During the bloodstream form, the parasite proliferates in a process termed cell cycle progression. Although changes in cell cycle regulation have been documented in the mammalian bloodstream form, relatively little is known about the parasite's protein kinases ( PKs ) involved in the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. To address this, we generated a library of 190 predicted PKs, allowing independent inducible knockdown of each of the parasite's 190 PKs. Screening this library using a cell viability assay identified \u226542 PKs that are required for normal bloodstream form proliferation in culture. A secondary screen identified two PKs whose depletion resulted in cell cycle defects including in G1/S, kinetoplast replication/segregation, mitosis and cytokinesis, 15 of which are novel cell cycle regulators. One PK, RDK1, is a membrane-associated STE11-like PK, whilst the other PK, RDK2, is a NEK PK that is essential for parasite proliferation. RDK1 acts in conjunction with the PTP1/PIP39 phosphatase cascade to block uncontrolled bloodstream to procyclic form differentiation. While RDK1 is a PK whose depletion efficiently induces differentiation in the absence of known triggers, RDK2 is a PK whose depletion efficiently induces differentiation in the presence of known triggers. Thus, the RNAi library provides a valuable asset for functional analysis of cell signalling pathways in African trypanosomes."

We have found that a mutant lacking these domains is more sensitive to the immune system, and we identified three mutants that are significantly more sensitive to the immune system than the original mutant. We also found that this mutant fails to form punctate membrane domains, which we believe is due to the increased sensitivity to membrane damaging agents, such as those found inside the cell. We also identified a mutant that is less sensitive to the immune system, and we found that this mutant is also significantly more sensitive to membrane damaging agents.

We find that the median age of haplotypes carrying variants is 50 to 160 generations across populations within Europe or Asia, and 170 to 320 generations within Africa. Haplotypes shared between Europeans are much older with median ages for haplotypes shared between Europe and Asia ranging from 320 to 670 generations. The distribution of the ages of haplotypes is informative about their demography, revealing ancient bottlenecks, ancient splits, and more modern connections between populations."

Although CD8+ T cells are able to kill infected cells, they can become exhausted when a chronic infection develops. PD-L1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed by many viruses. In this study we analyzed the role of PD-L1 expression on infected target cells. We found that PD-L1 expression is elevated during the early phase of retroviral infection, but remains low during the late phase of infection. In FV infected mice, we observed that PD-L1 expression levels are elevated after infection with a retroviral that replicates in cells of the immune system. In these infected mice, the population of PD-L1high cells escaped elimination and formed a reservoir for chronic retroviral replication. The ability of PD-L1 to drive CD8+ T cell effector responses is dependent on its expression on target cells. Our findings indicate that PD-L1 expression on infected cells can provide a mechanism for CD8+ T cells to escape elimination."

Development of new vaccines is urgently needed to prevent the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. The 2C7 peptide is a conserved ligand binding site in the 2C7 receptor ( 2C7R ) on Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The 2C7 epitope is expressed by 94% of gonococci that reside in the human genital tract and by 95% of first passaged isolates. Absence of the 2C7 epitope shortens the time of gonococcal carriage in a mouse model of genital infection. We developed a peptide mimic ( MAP1 ) as an immunologic surrogate of the 2C7-OS epitope and reconfigured it into a multi-antigenic peptide, ( MAP1 ). To test vaccine efficacy of MAP1, we immunized mice with a complement-dependent bactericidal monoclonal antibody specific for the 2C7 epitope or were actively immunized with MAP1. Mice immunized with MAP1 cleared infection in 5 days vs. 9 days in mice immunized with control peptide ( p\u200a=\u200a0. 0001 and p\u200a=\u200a0. 0002, respectively in two replicate experiments ). Bacterial burden was lower over the course of infection in passively immunized vs. control mice in both experiments. Bacterial burden was also inversely related to vaccine antibodies induced in the vagina. The OS epitope defined by mAb 2C7 may represent an effective vaccine target against gonorrhea, which is rapidly becoming incurable with currently available antibiotics."

We demonstrate that O1 is able to convert the recipient by a single-step exchange of large fragments of DNA. These results and the successful serogroup conversion of an O1 strain by O37 genomic DNA indicate that chitin-induced natural transformation might be a common mechanism for serogroup conversion in aquatic habitats and for the emergence of V. cholerae variants that are better adapted for survival in environmental niches or more pathogenic for humans."

First, the simplest demographic models can be used to provide information about the population dynamics; second, models that are more complex are used to describe the underlying epidemiological processes. In particular, population dynamic models are often used to infer epidemiological parameters such as birth, death, or migration rates. However, these models are often limited to single population models and cannot be used to infer the past dynamics of the host or pathogen.

We showed that the parasite induces several important signaling pathways including activation of transcription factors, growth factors and cytokines. Our results also indicated that the parasite alters the expression of several genes important for the early response to infection.

Increased risks were associated with exposure to milk sourced from cows, sheep, and goats, but not camels. Our data suggest that exposure to raw milk may contribute to a significant number of cases of RVFV, especially during outbreaks and in endemic areas, and that some animal species may be associated with a higher risk for RVFV exposure.

We have identified the c-di-AMP synthase responsible for synthesizing c-di-AMP in the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, a unicellular green alga that is commonly used as a biofuel to make lignocellulosic biomass. We used a c-di-AMP genetic interaction screen to identify pathways where the signaling nucleotide is active. This method is powerful, as we can determine the functions of proteins in the absence of the nucleotide. We found that c-di-AMP is produced by an enzyme of the diadenylate cyclase family, which was previously unexplored experimentally. Loss of this enzyme resulted in increased oxidative stress and death during the nighttime portion of day-night cycles, in which potassium transport is implicated.

We found that although the sst1 locus was not impaired in mice carrying the sst1 susceptible ( sst1S ) locus, the mice were highly tolerant of the induced immune response, displaying higher clinical scores, more severe lung inflammation, and the development of fibrosis compared to wild type mice. This correlated with increased activated caspase-3 in the lungs of infected sst1S mice. Infection with C. pneumoniae resulted in a shift in the secreted cytokine profile towards enhanced production of interferon-\u03b2 and interleukin-10, and induced apoptotic cell death, which was dependent on secretion of interferon-\u03b2.

The results were strongly predictive for genes with protective immune phenotypes: genes meeting the screen criteria were significantly more likely to display a functional phenotype against malaria infection than genes not meeting the criteria. Thus, an evolution-based screen can efficiently prioritize candidate genes for labor-intensive downstream functional testing, and safely allow the elimination of genes not meeting the screen criteria. The suite of immune genes with characteristics similar to the APL1-TEP1 selective sweep appears to be more widespread in the A. coluzzii genome than previously recognized. The immune gene differentiation may be a consequence of adaptation of A. coluzzii to new pathogens encountered in its niche expansion during the separation from A. gambiae, although the role, if any of natural selection by Plasmodium is unknown. Application of the screen allowed identification of new functional immune factors, and assignment of new functions to known immune factors. We describe biochemical interactions between immune proteins that underlie functional activity for malaria infection, which highlights the interplay between pathogen specificity and immune complexes."

However, the native spike protein is highly variable, and it is unclear whether the \u201cnative\u201d spike protein would be more stable. Here, we evaluate the stability of different HIV-1 subtypes and show that the native spike protein is well-structured, and stable at a high temperature. However, the native spike protein is more stable at a lower temperature, and the presence of a lower temperature leads to a stronger neutralization response. Since the native spike protein is the target of the current HIV-1 vaccine design, the stability of the native spike protein and its stability should be considered in future vaccine design efforts."

The significance of this pathway was confirmed using functional-deficient cells, TALEN-mediated gene disruption, RNA interference and pharmacologic inhibition.

Therefore, we designed cAMP analogues by a structure-guided approach that act as Epac2-selective agonists both in vitro and in vivo. These analogues activate Epac2 about two orders of magnitude more potently than cAMP. The high potency arises from increased affinity as well as increased maximal activation. Crystallographic studies demonstrate that this is due to unique interactions. At least one of the Epac2-specific agonists, Sp-8-BnT-cAMPS ( S-220 ), enhances glucose-induced insulin secretion in human pancreatic cells.

Some bacterial pathogens have evolved to use host enzymes to inactivate these defenses, probably as a result of their evolutionary convergence. An intriguing question remains whether eukaryotic pathogens or parasitic bacteria may use host enzymes as immune-suppressive toxins to target the same key genes as bacterial pathogens. We demonstrate here that the parasitic wasp Leptopilina boulardi, a wasp model parasitic for fruit fly hosts, uses its RhoGAP toxin, LbGAP, to inactivate the Drosophila host immune system. We show that LbGAP is a parasite toxin that can protect parasitoid eggs from the immune response of Drosophila larvae. This activity is conserved in other parasitic wasp species and in many other organisms, including humans, suggesting that eukaryotic pathogens may have evolved to use RhoGAP as virulence factors. In addition, we show that eukaryotic and bacterial RhoGAP toxins are structurally similar, but that they differ only in their ability to bind to the host immune system. These results suggest that eukaryotic and bacterial pathogens may use host enzymes as virulence factors, and that the mechanisms they use to inactivate host defenses are conserved between eukaryotes and parasitic wasps."

The action potential propagation in the central nervous system ( CNS ) is a crucial process for information transfer and for proper sensory and motor function.

It has been widely considered that defects in myelin junctions lead to neurological diseases such as hereditary neuropathy ( HNPP ). However, the exact mechanism of myelin insulator breakdown is still unclear. Here, we have addressed this question by using a mouse model of HNPP ( Pmp22+/- ), a mouse model with a mutation in the Pmp22 gene. We found that abnormal myelin junctions occur before the axon leads to abnormal myelin permeability. The abnormal myelin permeability is due to increased activation of the molecular signaling molecule PAK1, which is known to be important in regulating actin polymerization. Blocking PAK1 prevented the progression of myelin junction disruption and nerve conduction failure in Pmp22+/- mice. Our findings explain how abnormal myelin permeability is caused in HNPP, leading to impaired action potential propagation in the absence of demyelination."

Here we investigate piRNA pathway function and TE regulation in the F1 hybrids of interspecific crosses between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. We confirm previous reports showing that intraspecific crosses are characterized by derepression of paternally inherited TE families that are rare or absent from the maternal genome and piRNA pool, consistent with the role of maternally deposited piRNAs in shaping TE silencing. In contrast to the intraspecific cross, we discover that interspecific hybrids are characterized by widespread derepression of both maternally and paternally inherited TE families. Furthermore, we demonstrate that interspecific hybrids closely resemble piRNA effector-protein mutants in both TE misregulation and aberrant piRNA production. We suggest that TE derepression in interspecific hybrids largely reflects adaptive divergence of piRNA pathway genes rather than species-specific differences in TE-derived piRNAs."

During muscle development, myofibrils contain immature sarcomeres, which gradually mature into their pseudocrystalline order. Although the general importance of myofibrils for muscle development is well established, our understanding of myofibril assembly and sarcomere maturation is still limited. Here, we applied polarization-resolved microscopy to determine the molecular order of actin during myofibrillogenesis in vivo. This method revealed that, concomitantly with muscle tension buildup in the myotube, myofibrils increase in number, preceding the formation of immature sarcomeres. Molecular actin order increases, precedes the formation of immature sarcomeres. Actin order continues to increase while myofibrils and sarcomeres mature. Myosin motor activity is required for the proper and coordinated assembly of long myofibrils but is not required for the high actin order buildup during sarcomere maturation.

H5N1 virus has recently emerged in Egypt and has been responsible for hundreds of thousands of human infections. However, the mechanism behind this pandemic is unclear. H5N1 virus has recently changed its receptor specificity, from \u03b12, 3- to \u03b12, 6-linked sialic acid ( SA ). These changes in receptor specificity may be important for H5N1 virus to become pandemic. Here, we found that recent H5N1 viruses isolated from humans in Egypt, clustered into several new H5 sublineages, and were likely responsible for their increased human H5N1 infections. We also found mutations in the receptor binding sites of H5N1 viruses, which are responsible for their increased virulence in mice. Our findings suggest that new H5 sublineages with \u03b12, 6 SA specificity have emerged during viral diversification in bird populations and subsequently spread to humans. These findings provide new insights into the pandemic potential of H5N1 influenza virus and may help to develop new antiviral strategies for this highly pathogenic virus."

Glycolytic transcriptional regulation is important for metabolic flexibility and virulence of pathogens in diverse niches. We investigated the transcriptional control of carbohydrate metabolism in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans and identified two factors, Tye7p and Gal4p, as key regulators of glycolysis. When respiration was inhibited or oxygen was limited, a gal4tye7 strain showed a severe growth defect when cultured on glucose, fructose or mannose as carbon sources. Gal4p also bound the glycolytic promoter sequences and activated the genes. Tye7p bound the promoter sequences of the glycolytic genes and activated their expression during growth on either fermentable or non-fermentable carbon sources. Gal4p bound the promoter sequences and activated the genes although to a lesser extent than Tye7p. Intriguingly, Tye7p and Gal4p were responsible for the complete induction of the glycolytic genes under hypoxic growth conditions. Tye7p and Gal4p also regulated unique sets of carbohydrate metabolic genes. Tye7p bound and activated genes involved in trehalose, glycogen, and glycerol metabolism, while Gal4p regulated the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This suggests that Tye7p represents the key transcriptional regulator of carbohydrate metabolism in C. albicans and Gal4p provides a carbon source-dependent fine-tuning of gene expression while regulating the metabolic flux between respiration and fermentation pathways."

We found that UL97 is required for efficient nuclear egress from the nucleus, and it directly phosphorylates lamin A/C, which is required for efficient viral replication. UL97-mediated phosphorylation of lamin A/C is dependent on the presence of the Cdc2/Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( Cdk1 ) enzyme, which is responsible for disassembling the nuclear lamina during mitosis.

One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV. Using cross-linker assisted mass spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in 247 of 272 SFTSV isolates previously reported. Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 247 of 272 SFTSV isolates.

Here, we assess the fitness impact of escape mutations in Env gene variants in a cohort of CTL infected with HIV in the first year of infection, and compare these to those of other HIV-infected individuals. We show that escape mutations in Env variants are associated with significant fitness costs, whereas most escape mutations in the Env gene are neutral, suggesting a balance between immunologic escape and replicative fitness costs.

It is known to be an important determinant of adaptive evolution. However, to date only a few studies have focused on epistasis in adaptation. Here, we have analyzed the patterns of epistasis during adaptation by focusing on a pair of proteins that are of great interest, of which only one is subject to a well-defined pressure for adaptive change. Specifically, we examine the nucleoproteins from human and swine influenza, which are under continual selection to evade recognition by acquired immune memory, while swine influenza experiences less such selection due to the fact that pigs are less likely to be infected with influenza regularly in a lifetime. We find that human influenza is under strong purifying selection in its adaptation, but swine influenza is subject to a strong adaptive response. Our results demonstrate that epistasis is an important determinant of adaptive evolution, and that it is dependent on the underlying evolutionary forces at play."

The GRANules are the main components responsible for the assembly of plant stroma and the formation of granules in the plastid stroma. However, the molecular mechanisms of how these components function in the plant growth and development are still largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that PTST, a plastidial protein, is specifically required for the biosynthesis of amylose, a major component of plant material. We show that PTST physically interacts with Arabidopsis thaliana PTST via a coiled coil. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the coiled coil domain of PTST is required for its localisation to starch granules, which is important for its function. Using a modified version of PTST, we show that PTST is involved in the targeting of GBSS to starch granules. Collectively, these findings provide important information on the function of PTST in the plant growth and development. Furthermore, this study reveals a new function of PTST, which is exclusively required for the biosynthesis of amylose, and identifies a novel mechanism for the targeting of plant proteins to the plastid stroma."

A majority of the maize genome is derived from TEs that can be classified into different orders and families based on their mechanism of transposition and sequence similarity, respectively. TE families themselves are highly methylated and it can be tempting to view them as a single uniform group. However, the analysis of DNA methylation profiles in flanking regions provides evidence for distinct groups of chromatin properties at different TE families. These differences among TE families are reproducible in different tissues and different inbred lines. TE families with varying levels of DNA methylation in flanking sequence also show distinct patterns of chromatin accessibility and modifications within the TEs. The differences in the patterns of DNA methylation flanking TE families arise from a combination of non-random insertion preferences of TE families, changes in DNA methylation triggered by the insertion of the TE and subsequent selection pressure. A set of nearly 70, 000 TE polymorphisms among four assembled maize genomes were used to monitor the level of DNA methylation at haplotypes with and without the TE insertions. In many cases, TE families with high levels of DNA methylation in flanking sequence are enriched for insertions into highly methylated regions. The majority of the >2, 500 TE insertions into unmethylated regions of the genome are responsible for changes in DNA methylation in haplotypes with the TE, suggesting the widespread potential for TE insertions to condition altered methylation in conserved regions of the genome."

Since the network comprises a large number of molecules with varying cell context and time-dependent levels of expression, it can give rise to a wide range of plausible cellular states that are difficult to track. Using kinetic parameters for individual reactions in the component pathways, we have developed a theoretical framework and gained new insights into cellular regulation of the network. Specifically, we developed a mathematical model to quantify the importance of protein N-glycosylation and synthesis of the DPAGT1 encoded enzyme, GPT, in determining the abundance of cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin. We confirmed the role of axin in \u03b2-catenin degradation. Finally, our data suggest that cell-cell adhesion is insensitive to E-cadherin recycling in the cell.

Instead, we want to know how likely it is that an infected patient can generate a resistant infection in a secondary host, and how likely it is that the resistant strain subsequently spreads. While estimates for these parameters can often be obtained from epidemiological data, such data is lacking for NI resistance in influenza. Here, we use an approach that does not rely on epidemiological data.

The main signal transduction devices in bacteria are two-component systems that detect external stimuli and inhibit the response regulator, the effector response regulator. Despite the high degree of sequence homology, Rap proteins exert their activity by two different mechanisms: inducing the kinase activity of the effector response regulator or blocking its response regulator. However, the regulatory mechanism involving Rap proteins is even more complex since Rap activity is antagonized by specific signaling peptides ( Phr ) through a mechanism that remains unknown at the molecular level. Using X-ray crystallography, we determined the structure of RapF, the anti-activator of competence RR ComA, alone and in complex with PhrF. The structure revealed that PhrF blocks the RapF-ComA interaction through an allosteric mechanism. PhrF accommodates in the C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain of RapF by inducing its constriction, a conformational change propagated by a pronounced rotation to the N-terminal ComA-binding domain. This movement partially disrupts the ComA binding site by triggering the ComA disassociation, whose interaction with RapF is also sterically impaired in the PhrF-induced conformation of RapF. Sequence analyses of the Rap proteins, guided by the RapF-PhrF structure, unveil the molecular basis of Phr recognition and discrimination, allowing us to relax the Phr specificity of RapF by a single residue change."

We found that this wave propagating from the wound front exhibits a wave of acceleration and stretching that appears to increase directionality. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the coordinated migration is related to the emergence of a backward propagating wave of migration with about an hour phase lag. This suggests that the coordinated migration emerges due to the acceleration and stretching that seems to increase directionality. Together, our data and simplified modeling-based assessments suggest that accelerated migration is due to the emergence of a directional migration mode that temporarily decreases the velocity components orthogonal to the direction defined by the monolayer geometry."

We have shown previously that T. brucei can interact with heart muscle cells ( cardiomyocytes ) to induce arrhythmias in the heart. However, it is unknown whether the arrhythmias observed in vivo are also present during in vivo infection in the experimental animal models. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the cardiac dysfunction observed in vivo is indeed present in the infection models, but that the presence of cardiac arrhythmias is modified by the presence of the beta-adrenergic agonist isproterenol ( ISO ). Our results provide a new opportunity to accelerate our understanding of AT-induced cardiac pathophysiology and to identify potential therapeutic targets."

The Thai-Cambodia border is the epicenter for drug-resistant falciparum malaria. Previous studies have shown that the two most common causes of resistance, chloroquine and pyrimethamine, originated in this region. However, there is a dearth in understanding the origin and evolution of these two types of resistance. In the present study, we investigated the origin and evolution of one of the most commonly used drugs against malaria, sulfadoxine. We used the recently developed method of analyzing the genetic diversity of P. falciparum and the diversity of drug resistant parasites to obtain a better understanding of the origin and evolution of this important drug-resistant class of parasites. Our data show that the two different types of resistance originated independently from the same gene in this study, and that the triple mutant parasites originated from multiple independent genes."

We also show that this \u201cnecroptotic\u201d form of cell death is triggered by exposure of PS to the outer membrane. We also show that necroptotic cells exposed PS to the outer membrane can release other proteins and that this release is important to the inflammatory response. These findings demonstrate that necroptotic cells exposed PS to the outer membrane can be released from the cell surface and may be able to recognize and engulf other apoptotic cells.

Overexpression of OsMADS25 remarkably enhanced the primary root length and lateral root density, whereas RNAi silence of this gene reduced root length and sensitivity to salinity and oxidative stress, and recombinant OsGST4 protein was found to have ROS\u2013scavenging activity in vitro. Expectably, overexpression of OsMADS25 significantly enhanced the tolerance to salinity and oxidative stress in rice plants, with the elevated activity of antioxidant enzymes, increased accumulation of osmoprotective solutes proline and reduced frequency of open stoma. Furthermore, OsMADS25 specifically activated the transcription of OsP5CR, a key component of proline biosynthesis, by binding to its promoter. Interestingly, overexpression of OsMADS25 significantly enhanced the tolerance to salinity and oxidative stress in rice, with the elevated activity of antioxidant enzymes, increased accumulation of osmoprotective solutes proline and reduced frequency of open stoma.

Although it has been shown that polyploidization occurs in most organisms, the molecular mechanism of the transition from the mitotic to aneuploid state remains enigmatic. In this study, we investigated the molecular evolution process during the transition from the mitotic to aneuploid state by the use of laboratory evolution experiments. We show that a yeast-specific protein kinase, Sch9, which is activated by TORC1 and other intracellular signaling pathways, is required for the evolution of aneuploid genomes. When cells were challenged with conditions causing ancestral cells to evolve aneuploidy, tetraploidy was maintained in the evolved lines. Our results reveal that the evolution of aneuploid genomes is determined by the abundance of Sch9, and that Sch9 is necessary and sufficient for the transition to aneuploid evolution."

New antibiotics decrease the antibiotic resistance level, but old drugs are increasingly used in several countries. However, treatment options for patients that are resistant to existing antibiotics are increasingly increasing. This is a serious issue, especially when the occurrence of bacteria resistant to all antibiotics becomes critical. We use a mathematical model to explore the effect of various antibiotic prescription strategies on the emergence of MDR bacteria. We find that, in the case of the commonly prescribed drug, the double treatment of an antibiotic that is already restricted can reduce the number of incorrectly treated patients and the spread of bacteria resistant to both common antibiotics. Our results suggest that, when antibiotics are prescribed in excess, the risk of developing resistance to all currently used antibiotics is reduced."

Candida albicans, the most common fungal pathogen of humans, can invade the kidney and cause fungal persistence, leading to renal failure. Treatment of disseminated infections in hospitalized patients is hampered by drug toxicity and lack of vaccines against Candida spp. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of the innate immune response to C. albicans infection using a murine model of disseminated infection. We found that IL-17, a cytokine that regulates the function of other immune cells, plays an important role in the protection against Candida infection. IL-17 promotes the Kallikrein-Kinin System ( KKS ), a multi-protein complex that mediates the activation of antimicrobial defense mechanisms. In the absence of IL-17, the KKS fails to limit fungal growth in the kidney, and mice succumb to infection with Candida albicans. We show that IL-17 promotes the KKS by repressing the expression of the KKS target genes, including the KKS protein Kk1. Furthermore, we show that IL-17 inhibits fungal growth in the kidney, and that this effect is dependent on the KKS. We propose that IL-17 is a critical regulator of the KKS in the absence of IL-17, and that the KKS may be a target for the development of new therapeutic strategies against this fatal fungal infection."

M. oryzae is an important model fungus for studying fungal adaptation to new resistance genes. Recently, a subtelomeric effector gene family was shown to be important for the rapid adaptation of M. oryzae to new resistance genes. However, the whole fungal genome is not sequenced, and the effectors are unknown. We found that the effector gene family is highly variable in its genome location, especially in rice-infecting isolates. Most of the effectors were flanked by a retrotransposon, presumably contributing to its multiple translocation across the genome. When expressed in M. oryzae, most effector genes could elicit Pita-mediated resistance, even those from non-rice isolates. However, the effector gene family member, VRPA3, which lacks avirulence activity, was stably located on chromosome 7 in a vast majority of isolates. These results suggest that the diversification in genome location of VRPA3 is a consequence of recognition by Pita in rice. We propose a model that the multiple translocation of VRPA3 may be associated with its frequent loss and recovery mediated by its transfer among individuals in asexual populations. This model implies that the high mobility of VRPA3 may be a key mechanism accounting for the rapid adaptation toward Pita."

Circadian clocks are typically driven by inter-neuronal coupling, and the timing of synchronization is usually synchronized by the neuropeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ). However, the mechanisms and circuits involved in achieving this coupling remain unclear. Here, we computationally study the coupling mediated by the primary neuropeptide, Viper, and its canonical receptor, VPAC2R. We find that synchrony is only possible if Viper is released in-phase with activators of Per expression. Moreover, anti-phasic Viper release suppresses coherent rhythms by moving the network into a desynchronous state. Finally, experimentally observed rhythms in VPAC2R have little effect on network synchronization, but can improve the amplitude of the SCN network rhythms while narrowing the network entrainment range. We further show that these findings are valid across several computational network models. Thus, we identified a general design principle to achieve robust synchronization: An activating coupling agent, such as Viper, must act in-phase with the activity of core-clock promoters. More generally, the phase of coupling is as critical as the strength of coupling from the viewpoint of synchrony and entrainment."

Here, we report that the expression of a key seed growth factor, namely the WRKY transcription factor gene Minimum ( MAXI3 ), is repressed before fertilization and after 4 days of pollination, but is activated by SYG1. In the absence of MAXI3, the expression of a key seed growth factor, namely the LRR receptor kinase gene, fails to activate. We reveal a novel two-step amplification mechanism in which SHB1 activates transcription of a seed growth factor gene by binding to its promoter and activating transcription of a seed growth factor gene. This mechanism allows a rapid switch from a low expression level of the seed growth factor to a high level of expression, which is required to activate seed development."

Because this is a fundamental challenge of all biological systems that execute programs in response to stimuli, we developed a generalized time-frequency analysis ( TFA ) framework to systematically explore the dynamical properties of biomolecular networks. We focused on two well-characterized yeast gene regulatory networks that respond to carbon-source shifts and a mammalian innate immune regulatory network. The networks are comprised of two basic architectures. Dual positive and negative feedback loops make up the yeast galactose network; whereas overlapping positive and negative feed-forward loops are common to the yeast fatty-acid response network and the LPS-induced network of macrophages. We found that the wild type galactose network was highly responsive while the oleate network has greater noise suppression ability. The LPS network appeared more balanced, showing less bias toward noise suppression or responsiveness. Exploration of the network parameter space exposed dramatic differences in system behaviors for each network. These studies highlight fundamental structural and dynamical principles that underlie each network, reveal constrained parameters of positive and negative feedback and feed-forward strengths that tune the networks appropriately for their respective biological roles, and demonstrate the general utility of the TFA approach for systems and synthetic biology."

According to accepted models, NHR peptides can bind two targets in an intermediate fusion conformation; however, the orientation towards the endogenous NHR should be important. We tested this hypothesis by conjugating NHR to the cell membrane and two mutations that alter the NHR region on the cell membrane. The finding that NHR can bind NHR and that the peptides bind to the receptor is significant because NHR is a known target for AIDS drugs. We also found that the peptides bind NHR in a cell membrane-dependent manner. This suggests a new approach for developing potent HIV-1 inhibitors."

We show how a single mutation can be able to change the antigen-binding site of AB1, changing the antigen-binding site of the antibody to a new antigen. The new binding site of AB1 has several amino acid changes, making it possible to identify a single mutation that would make an antibody antigen binding site more efficient.

In this study, we collected Cryptococcus isolates from HIV/AIDS patients in Los Angeles County, California and show that these isolates are virulent in mice and human macrophages. We also show that the C. gattii population is divided into two distinct molecular types, termed VGIII and VGIIIb. While the VGIII population is well known for its role in infection of immunocompetent hosts, the VGIII population has previously been neglected, with only one known molecular type ( VGIIIa ) being infectious. Our data indicate that the California AIDS pandemic strain is primarily caused by the C. gattii VGIII population. We also show that the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the C. gattii population can be divided into two molecular types, which are found in the Pacific Northwest and California coast. Our study suggests that other molecular types of Cryptococcus may cause disease in immunocompetent hosts, and provides insight into possible differences in host immune response among these three species."

Compared to other members of the Jumonji C domain-containing protein family, the cellular activity of JMJD6 is still largely unexplored. In this study, we report that JMJD6 is physically associated with the tumor suppressor p53. We demonstrate that p53 indeed exists as a hydroxylated protein in vivo and that the hydroxylation occurs mainly on lysine 382 of p53. We show that JMJD6 antagonizes p53 acetylation, promotes the association of p53 with its negative regulator MDMX, and represses transcriptional activity of p53. Knockdown of JMJD6 enhances p53 transcriptional activity, arrests cells in the G1 phase, promotes cell proliferation and sensitizes cells to DNA damaging agent-induced cell death. Importantly, knockdown of JMJD6 represses p53-dependent colon cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo. Our results reveal a novel posttranslational modification for p53 and support the pursuit of JMJD6 as a potential biomarker for colon cancer aggressiveness and a potential target for colon cancer intervention."

In the human brain, computations in the sensory cortex have been linked to a variety of cognitive functions such as the ability to focus attention on the stimulus of interest, and to coordinate subsequent behaviors. However, the underlying mechanisms of these computations remain largely unknown. Here, we identify the computational mechanisms underlying the rate-of-change computation, a basic computational operation underlying the timing of sensory inputs to the brain. Our computer simulations show that the rate-of-change circuit operates robustly in cortical networks through the combination of two ubiquitous brain mechanisms: short-term synaptic depression and spike-frequency adaptation. Our results indicate that the rate-of-change circuit can be embedded in a convergently connected network to anticipate temporally incoming synaptic inputs, in quantitative agreement with experimental findings on anticipation of moving stimuli in the primary visual cortex. Given the robustness of the mechanism and the widespread nature of the physiological machinery involved, we suggest that rate-of-change computation and temporal anticipation are principal, hard-wired functions of neural information processing in the cortical microcircuit."

We show that the Th2-inducible gene Retnla suppresses the development of Th2 immunity by regulating eosinophil and epithelial cell production of IL-4 and IL-13 and the production of Th2 cytokines. In the absence of Retnla, eosinophils and epithelial cells were found to be highly activated and produced Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13.

We identified a number of ESCRT factors required for HBV replication, and focused our study on HGS ( HRS, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate ) in the ESCRT-0 complex. Aberrant levels of HGS suppressed HBV transcription, replication and virion secretion. Hydrodynamic delivery of HGS in a mouse model significantly suppressed viral replication and virion secretion. Surprisingly, overexpression of HGS stimulated the release of HBV naked capsids, irrespective of their viral RNA, DNA, or empty contents. Surprisingly, empty naked capsids of HBc 1\u2013147 could still be promoted for secretion by HGS. HGS exerted a strong positive effect on the secretion of naked capsids, at the expense of a reduced level of virions. The association between HGS and HBc appears to be ubiquitin-independent. Furthermore, HBc is preferentially co-localized with HGS near the cell periphery, instead of near the punctate endosomes in the cytoplasm. In summary, our work demonstrated the importance of an optimum level of HGS in HBV propagation. In addition to an effect on HBV transcription, HGS can diminish the pool size of intracellular nucleocapsids with ongoing genome maturation, probably in part by promoting the secretion of naked capsids.

Activation of SKN-1, either by acute pharmacological treatment with the mitochondrial toxin sodium arsenite or by mutations that cause constitutive SKN-1 activation, results in defects in neuromuscular function. Additionally, elimination of the conserved WD40 repeat protein WDR-23, a principal negative regulator of SKN-1, results in impaired locomotion and synaptic vesicle and neuropeptide release from cholinergic motor axons. Mutations that abolish skn-1 activity restore normal neuromuscular function to wdr-23 mutants and animals treated with toxin. We show that negative regulation of SKN-1 by WDR-23 in the intestine, but not at neuromuscular junctions, is necessary and sufficient for proper neuromuscular function. We also show that SKN-1 and its target genes are differentially expressed in the intestine and neurons, and that the effects of WDR-23 on neuromuscular function are dependent on its interaction with cullin E3 ubiquitin ligases.

Understanding the biology of the parasite is crucial for developing a better treatment, but current research has largely focused on characterizing the surface proteins of the parasite. These proteins mediate binding to a variety of host tissues and mediate the parasite's ability to survive and multiply within the host. In addition to being important targets for drug intervention, these proteins also represent a major component of the parasite's life cycle. Despite their importance, little is known about how their genetic variation impacts the outcome of the infection. We have identified genes in the parasite's genome that are related in sequence and are important for the parasite's ability to survive and multiply within its host. These genes are grouped into a few functional units called domains. Interestingly, some domains are short and are conserved in the parasite genome while others are long and are diverse. These results suggest that these genes may be grouped into functionally related units and that their variation in sequence can be a source of adaptation in the parasite. Our results also suggest that the same evolutionary forces that act on the parasite's gene repertoire may also shape the diversity of the parasite's surface proteins."

Our results indicate that intermolecular hydrodynamic interactions reduce 1D diffusivity by 30%. On the other hand, structural fluctuations give rise to steric collisions between the CG-proteins and DNA, resulting in faster 1D sliding of the protein. Proteins with low binding sites consistent with experimental estimates of non-specific DNA binding show hopping along the CG-DNA. This hopping significantly increases sliding speed. These simulation studies provide additional insights into the mechanism of how DNA binding proteins find their target sites on the genome."

At the same time, proliferation of stem and progenitor cells has to be carefully controlled to prevent hyper-proliferative diseases. Mechanisms that ensure this balance, thus promoting proliferative homeostasis, are expected to be critical for longevity in animals. The intestinal epithelium of Drosophila provides an accessible model to test this prediction. In aging flies, the intestinal epithelium degenerates due to over-proliferation of intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) and mis-differentiation of ISC daughter cells, resulting in intestinal dysplasia. Here we show that conditions that prevent tissue renewal lead to lifespan shortening, whereas genetic manipulations that promote proliferative homeostasis extend lifespan. These include reduced Insulin/IGF and Jun-N-terminal Kinase signaling activities, as well as over-expression of stress-protective genes in stem cell lineages. Interestingly, proliferative activity in aging intestinal epithelia correlates with longevity over a range of genotypes, with maximal lifespan when intestinal proliferation is reduced but not completely inhibited. Our results highlight the importance of the balance between regenerative processes and strategies to prevent hyperproliferative disorders and demonstrate that promoting proliferative homeostasis in aging metazoans is a viable strategy to extend lifespan."

In this study, we investigate how the PTS network integrates a wide range of nutrients and metabolites. We show that despite the complexity of the network, its core part operates in a surprisingly simple way, sensing the overall influx of sugars irrespective of the sugar identity and distributing this information equally through all studied branches of the network. Moreover, it also integrates several other specific metabolic inputs. We also show that the PTS network is able to transmit information directly to the chemotaxis pathway in a linear manner. This finding is surprising since the output of the PTS network is not only identical to that of the chemotaxis pathway, but also different from that of the classical signaling system. Finally, we show that the uninduced PTS network is better than the chemotactic network in terms of the quality of the carbon source and the capacity to respond to changes in the environment."

By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics.

ASFV infection increases the expression of eIF4G and eIF4E, whereas 4E-BP1 is hyperphosphorylated at early times post-infection and hypophosphorylated after 18 h. In fact, eIF4F is not essential for ASFV infection but is essential for virus production and spread.

Notably, the mitochondrial network is polarized in ASFV-infected cells co-localizing with ribosomes. At later times after ASFV infection, polyadenylated mRNAs disappear from the cytoplasm of Vero cells, except within the viral factories. The distribution of these pools of mRNAs is similar to the mitochondrial network and seems to be coupled and compartmentalized at the periphery of viral factories. At later times post-infection, cellular polyadenylated mRNAs and the translation machinery are degraded and recruit the host's translation machinery to viral factories.

Mechanical loading of the tendon is thought to regulate many aspects of the body's physiology including the strength of the healing response, scar anisotropy, and strength. However, the effects of mechanical loading on the fibroblast, the most abundant cells in the body, have been quantified in animal models, but the degree to which this model can explain the data from those experiments is unclear. Here, we developed a multiscale computational model of the rat Achilles tendon that incorporates the effect of mechanical loading on fibroblast behavior, and used it to predict fibroblast alignment and tissue-level strains. We compared our model predictions to experimental data from ten different studies. We found that a single set of cellular response curves can explain features of observed tendon healing across a wide array of reported experiments in rats\u2013including the paradoxical finding that repairing transected tendon reverses the effect of loading on alignment\u2013without fitting the model to any data from those experiments. The key to these successful predictions was simulating the specific loading and surgical protocols to predict tissue-level strains, which then guided cellular behaviors according to response curves based on in vitro experiments. Our model results provide a potential explanation for the highly variable responses to mechanical loading reported in the tendon healing literature and may be useful in guiding the design of future experiments and interventions."

Colonizing the mucosa of the reproductive tract depends on the bacterial outer membrane porin, PorB, which is essential for ion and nutrient uptake. PorB is also targeted to host mitochondria and regulates apoptosis pathways to promote infections. How PorB traffics from the outer membrane of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to mitochondria and whether it modulates innate immune cells, such as macrophages, remains unclear. Here, we show that N. gonorrhoeae secretes PorB via outer membrane vesicles ( OMVs ). Purified OMVs contained primarily outer membrane proteins including oligomeric PorB. The porin was targeted to mitochondria of macrophages after exposure to purified OMVs and wild type N. gonorrhoeae. This was associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of apoptotic caspases and cell death in a time-dependent manner. Consistently, OMV-induced macrophage death was prevented with the pan-caspase inhibitor, Q-VD-PH. This shows that N. gonorrhoeae utilizes OMVs to target PorB to mitochondria and to induce apoptosis in macrophages, thus affecting innate immunity."

The lack of knowledge on the mode of action of Hsp90 inhibitors in filarial worms means that these drugs are likely to be developed by chance.

The assay is based upon the ability of small molecules to inhibit the binding of fluorescently labelled geldanamycin to Hsp90. We demonstrate that the assay works well with soluble extracts of Brugia, while extracts of the free-living nematode C. elegans fail to bind the probe, in agreement with data from other experiments. The assay is also suitable for high-throughput screening and provides the first example of a format with the potential to identify novel inhibitors of Hsp90 in filarial worms and in other parasitic species where Hsp90 may be a target."

Previous work has shown that male germ cells, which have a female fate, can change sex isoform expression to match that of the male germ cells. Here we show that the transcription factor Chinmo, which is conserved in male germ cells, represses sex isoform expression in the testis, a tissue that supports the germ cell lineage. In the absence of Chinarin ( a transcription factor that controls male germ cell differentiation ), sex isoform expression is increased to levels similar to those of the female germ cells. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of sex determination by which the sex hierarchy is maintained in sexually dimorphic tissues, and they show that sex isoform expression is controlled by the transcription factor Chinmo."

This strategy involves two Ank effectors that together regulate the subcellular localization of p65. The two Ank effectors target different host proteins and are essential for the ability of O. tsutsugamushi to survive. One of the Ank effectors, Ank1, mediates exportin1 B sensitivity. When the inhibitor is inactivated, the two Ank effectors both target p65 and exportin 1, and block nuclear translocation and p65 nuclear accumulation.

However, the mechanisms underlying transcription elongation are poorly understood. Here we investigated the mechano-chemical coupling in the transcription elongation of the single-subunit RNA polymerase T7 using extensive molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the PPi release is initiated by the PPi dissociation from two catalytic acids, followed by a comparatively slow activation process, and a highly flexible lysine residue that switches its side chain to pull PPi out. We also found that the activation process is hindered by charged residue associations as well as by local steric and hydrogen bond interactions. On the other hand, the activation is greatly assisted by a highly flexible lysine residue that moves its side chain to pull PPi out. The mechanism can apply in general to single subunit RNA and DNA polymerases with similar molecular structures and conserved key residues. Remarkably, the PPi release is not tightly coupled to opening motions of an O-helix in the microsecond MD simulations. Our study thus supports the Brownian ratchet scenario of the mechano-chemical coupling in the transcription elongation of the single-subunit polymerase."

Here, we have dissected the role of the complement system as well as the individual activation pathways during the pandemic influenza virus infection using mouse strains deficient in various complement components. We show that the virus infection in C3-/- mice results in increased viral load and 100% mortality, which can be reversed by adoptive transfer of na\u00efve wild-type ( WT ) cells, purified splenic B cells, or passive transfer of immune sera from WT, but not C3-/- mice. Blocking of C3a and/or C5a receptor signaling in WT mice resulted in only partial mortality ( 24%-32% ) suggesting a necessary cross-talk between the classical and alternative pathways for providing effective protection. In vitro virus neutralization experiments performed to probe the cross-talk between the various pathways indicated that activation of the classical and alternative pathways is needed for its efficient neutralization. Examination of the virus-specific complement-binding antibodies in virus positive subjects showed that their levels vary among individuals. Together these results indicate that cooperation between the classical and alternative pathways not only results in efficient direct neutralization of the pandemic influenza virus, but also leads to the optimum generation of complement-mediated immunity against the virus."

We also show that this functional divergence is driven by the same mutation in a second duplicate, leading to loss of binding to the same target protein in both, which is required for eye development. Our results support the hypothesis that these two PAX6 duplicates are functionally interchangeable, and show that evolution has taken place in one of these duplicates, which is not required for eye development in the other.

Using the important human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen, we sought to determine critical host and pathogen factors that contribute to the induction of the host inflammatory response to this pathogen. We report that Chlamydia activates both canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes, but only canonical inflammasomes controlled IL-1\u03b2 processing which preceded pyroptosis. NADPH oxidase deficient macrophages were permissive to Chlamydia trachomatis replication and demonstrated increased type-1 interferon and inflammasome activation. Conversely, chlamydial replication was primed but did not activate inflammasomes and stimulated reduced type-1 interferon responses. This suggested bacterial replication or metabolism as important factors that determine interferon responses and inflammasome activation. We identified STING but not cGAS as a central mediator of inflammasome activation. Interestingly, exogenous delivery of a Chlamydia trachomatis metabolite and STING ligand\u2014cyclic di-AMP, recovered inflammasome activation to attenuated bacteria in a STING dependent manner thus indicating that a bacterial metabolite is a key factor initiating inflammasome activation through STING, independent of cGAS.

We show that water stress induces a stronger mutualistic relationship with the ant\u2013plant symbiosis in a Meso Rican precipitation gradient, and the stronger this relationship increases with water stress. Under water stress, Cordia plants also invest more in scaling up to the ant's defense, and the ant-plant symbiosis increases with water stress.

Previous studies have shown that splicing of BDF2 mRNA is limited by the splicing machinery. However, splicing and mRNA decay are not mutually exclusive, and splicing and mRNA decay are coupled. We have discovered that nuclear RNA degradation pathways play distinct roles in the regulation of BDF2 expression, as we show that the splicing machinery and the mRNA decay pathways are differentially activated in specific environmental conditions. We have also found that the splicing machinery can be activated by salt stress and repressed by hydroxyurea-induced DNA damage.

Influenza viruses in bats are unique among mammalian and avian viruses, but several species in the New World are capable of infecting birds. Here, we identified a novel influenza A virus in a flat-faced fruit bat ( Artibeus planirostris ) from Peru. Several Peruvian bat species were infected by this virus, and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that, in some gene segments, New World bats harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all other mammalian and avian species combined. Our results suggest that influenza A viruses may be carried in bats more than once and that influenza A viruses may have originated from bats in the past.

These results show that the two cysteine peptidases are highly protective against schistosome challenge infection when administered subcutaneously without adjuvant to outbred CD-1 mice and hamsters, and that the combination of both cysteine peptidases with glyeraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( SG3PDH ), an enzyme that degrades the amino acid cysteine, protects against challenge infection in CD-1 outbred mice and hamsters.

The present study aimed to determine if B. anthracis\u2013derived LT, the most prevalent toxin in anthrax disease, has any effect on NKT cells. The toxin is known to suppress immune responses during anthrax disease and intoxicates cells by protective antigen ( PA ). We observed that NKT cells expressed anthrax toxin receptors and bound more PA than other immune cell types. Further analysis revealed that LT inhibits TCR signaling in NKT cells due to the toxic effects of the PA\u2013activated MAP kinase kinase MEK-2.

Drosophila mutants lacking the translational regulator Bicaudal C ( BicC, the fly ortholog of vertebrate BICC1 implicated in renal cystogenesis ) exhibited progressive cystic degeneration of the renal tubules ( so-called \u201cmalpighian\u201d tubules ) and reduced renal function. The BicC protein was shown to bind to Drosophila ( d- ) myc mRNA in tubules. Elevation of d-Myc protein levels was a cause of tubular degeneration in BicC mutant flies. Activation of the Target of Rapamycin ( TOR ) kinase pathway, another common feature of PKD, was found in BicC mutant flies. Rapamycin administration substantially reduced the cystic phenotype in flies. We present new mechanistic insight on BicC function and propose that Drosophila may serve as a genetically tractable model for dissecting the evolutionarily-conserved molecular mechanisms of renal cystogenesis."

We investigated the local dynamics of two bacterial flotillins, FloA and FloT, in their native states, in order to determine their spatial distribution in the membrane. We show that FloA and FloT are highly similar in their local biochemical properties, but differ significantly in their spatial distribution. We also show that the two proteins are able to self-oligomerize, but that only the latter is capable of moving to and colocalizing with other proteins.

The model is capable of capturing the behavior of the bacterium in different gradients. Our results show that the bacterium is able to efficiently respond to a given gradient by changing the concentration of the key cell signaling component, CheY-P. Our results suggest that the variability in the adaptation process among different bacteria may be evolutionary advantageous to allow the bacterium to efficiently respond to different external conditions. However, in liquid media, the variability in adaptation times among different bacterial species may be less important, because agar structure poses mainly negative selection against subpopulations with low levels of adaptation enzymes.

Strikingly, 37% of H1. 5 targets belong to gene family clusters, groups of genes that are located in proximity to each other on chromosomes. H1. 5 binding is associated with gene repression and is required for SIRT1 binding, H3K9me2 enrichment, and chromatin compaction. Depletion of H1. 5 results in loss of SIRT1 and H3K9me2, increased chromatin accessibility, deregulation of gene expression, and decreased cell growth. Our data reveal for the first time a specific and novel function for linker histone H1. 5 in maintenance of compact chromatin at defined gene families in differentiated human cells."

We also validated the role of YBX1 in the oncogenic pathway in colorectal cancer and showed that YBX1 is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. We conclude that MEK/ERK-dependent, YBX1-regulated genes are key components of the oncogenic pathway and that YBX1 is involved in the control of the oncogenic pathway in colorectal cancer cells."

Surprisingly, neutrophils extended chemotactic pseudopodia toward Escherichia coli and S. Typhimurium, but not toward S. Typhi. Bacterial-guided chemotaxis was dependent on the presence of complement component 5a ( C5a ) and C5a receptor ( C5aR ). Deletion of S. Typhi capsule biosynthesis genes markedly enhanced the chemotactic response of neutrophils in vitro. Furthermore, deletion of capsule biosynthesis genes heightened the association of S. Typhi with neutrophils in vivo through a C5aR-dependent mechanism. Collectively, these data suggest that expression of the virulence-associated ( Vi ) polysaccharide of S.

Antibiotic resistance is a major health concern in this species. Although it is well recognized that this organism can be found in the soil, there is a lack of information on the genes it carries. We have found a new set of genes in this species that have escaped detection by traditional gene detection approaches. These genes, or cryptic genes, encode proteins that do not have any detectable function yet. One cryptic gene, iiv14, encodes a protein, and is also found in the wild-type host. Introduction of the stop codon early in the gene resulted in rapid improvement of the ability of the bacteria to colonize soil. We therefore call this new gene \u201ccosA\u201d. These data suggest that, as is the case with eukaryotes, some bacterial genomes are more densely coded than currently recognized."

In this study, we analyzed 25, 383 dengue cases notified in Hanoi, Vietnam between 1998 and 2009. Age-specific rates of dengue cases, and the associated drivers of this increase in dengue incidence were calculated. We found that the incidence of dengue cases has been increasing year since 1999. This trend needs to be confirmed with serological surveys, followed by studies to determine the underlying drivers of this emergence.

The disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by the insect vector. There are no satisfactory drugs available, and the only way to treat the disease is to use drugs that are already in use to treat the other disease. Our research group focuses on the design of new inhibitors against T. cruzi. The first published crystal structures of the enzyme, which is present in all stages of the parasite life cycle, showed that the catalytic site is too small to allow any relevant drug design. In previous work, to break through the chemical space afforded to virtual screening and drug design, we generated intermediate models between the open ( ligand free ) and closed ( ligand bound ) forms of the enzyme. In the present work, we co-crystallized the enzyme with the selected inhibitors and found that they were covalently bound to the catalytic cysteine residues in the active site, thus explaining why these compounds act as irreversible inhibitors. The present results led us to the design of a new, more potent specific inhibitor, NG-P27. Co-crystallization of this new inhibitor with the enzyme allowed us to confirm the predicted protein functional motions and further characterize the chemical mechanism."

TSE shows variegation among egg chambers in ovaries when silencing is incomplete. We show that TSE displays an epigenetic transmission through meiosis, which involves an extrachromosomal maternally transmitted factor. We show that TSE is highly sensitive to mutations affecting both heterochromatin formation ( Su ( var ) 205 encoding Heterochromatin Protein 1 and Su ( var ) 3\u20137 ) and the repeat-associated small interfering RNA ( or rasiRNA ) silencing pathway ( aubergine, homeless, armitage, and piwi ). In contrast, TSE is not sensitive to mutations affecting r2d2, which is involved in the small interfering RNA ( or siRNA ) silencing pathway, nor is it sensitive to a mutation in loquacious, which is involved in the micro RNA ( or miRNA ) silencing pathway. These results, taken together with the recent discovery of TAS homologous small RNAs associated to PIWI proteins, support the proposition that TSE involves a repeat-associated small interfering RNA pathway linked to heterochromatin formation, which was co-opted by the P element to establish repression of its own transposition after its recent invasion of the D. melanogaster genome. Therefore, the study of TSE provides insight into the genetic properties of a germline-specific small RNA silencing pathway."

This hierarchical organization of cells means that a few clones ( i. e., cells and several generations of offspring ) are abundant while most are rare, which is called clonal dominance. Such dominance also occurred in published in vitro experiments with tumor cells in which genetic barcodes were used for lineage tracing. A potential source for such heterogeneity is that dominant clones derive from cancer stem cells with an unlimited self-renewal capacity. Furthermore, ongoing evolution and selection within the growing population may also induce clonal dominance. To understand how clonal dominance develops in the iterated growth and passage experiments, we built a computational model that accurately simulates these experiments. The model simulations reproduced the clonal dominance that developed in in vitro growth and passage experiments when the cell division rates vary between cells, due to a combination of initial variation and of ongoing mutational processes. In contrast, the experimental results can neither be reproduced with a model that considers random growth and passage, nor with a model based on cancer stem cells. Altogether, our model suggests that in vitro clonal dominance develops due to selection of fast-dividing clones."

We observed that HCMV infection dramatically impaired the rate of neuronogenesis and strongly increased PPAR\u03b3 levels and activity. Consistently, levels of 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid ( 9-HODE ), a known PPAR\u03b3 agonist, were significantly increased in infected NSCs. Likewise, exposure of uninfected NSCs to 9-HODE recapitulated the effect of infection on PPAR\u03b3 activity. We also demonstrated that ( 1 ) pharmacological activation of ectopically expressed PPAR\u03b3 was sufficient to induce impaired NSC differentiation and ( 2 ) treatment of HCMV-infected NSCs with the PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor T0071907 restored a normal rate of differentiation. The role of PPAR\u03b3 in the disease phenotype was strongly supported by the immunodetection of nuclear PPAR\u03b3 in brain germinative zones of congenitally infected fetuses ( N = 20 ).

We present a quantitative evolutionary model of TNs, subjecting the phylogenetic distance and the evolutionary changes of cis-regulatory sequence, gene expression and network structure to one probabilistic framework. Using the genomes of multiple species, this model can predict regulatory relationships between a transcription factor ( TF ) and its target genes in all species, and thus identify TN re-wiring events. Applying this model to analyze the pre-implantation development of three mammalian species, we identified the conserved and re-wired components of the TNs downstream to a set of TFs including Oct4, Gata3/4/6, cMyc and nMyc. Evolutionary events on the DNA sequence that led to turnover of TF binding sites were identified, including a birth of an Oct4 binding site by a 2nt deletion. In contrast to recent reports of large interspecies differences of TF binding sites and gene expression patterns, the interspecies difference in TF-target relationship is much smaller. The data showed increasing conservation levels from genomic sequences to TF-DNA interaction, gene expression, TN, and finally to morphology, suggesting that evolutionary changes are smaller at molecular than functional levels."

We further show that the loss of USF1 is important for p53 function in the presence of DNA damage. We demonstrate that the loss of USF1 compromises p53 function by enhancing the formation of p53-MDM2 complexes and MDM2-mediated degradation of p53. Consistently, we find that the loss of USF1 can restore the induction and activity of p53 in cells exposed to genotoxic stress. Our results establish that p53 function requires the ubiquitous stress sensor USF1 and provide new clues of how p53 loss of function can occur in any cell type."

How this coordination precisely works is unknown. In this work, we show that a group of plant-specific receptor-like kinases ( RLKs ) function in the tip-growing pollen tube, a highly specialized structure, to regulate cell wall integrity and growth. We show that the RLKs are essential to sustain growth by activating the expression of an enzyme that breaks down the cell wall, a process called exocytosis. Moreover, we show that NADPH oxidases, which are important for cell wall integrity, are able to generate the calcium signal needed to activate the cell wall. This finding suggests that NADPH oxidases may be important for plant growth, as their activation by cell wall integrity may be required for the proper growth of the pollen tube."

Our results show that the evolution of Bd as a globally important amphibian pathogen was initiated early in the evolution of this group. We also demonstrate that the timing of the gene family expansions that have occurred prior to the emergence of bd as a globally important amphibian pathogen is associated with the emergence of Bd as a globally important amphibian pathogen."

The recent rise in cases of this species across much of the world, with a global expansion of 6. 6 million cases, has resulted in the need for accurate estimates of where, and when, this species is present. This is essential for planning public health interventions such as drug treatment, vaccination, and vector control. In this study, we present a new algorithm that efficiently generates accurate estimates of the spatial distribution of this species in a country or region of interest. The algorithm is used to obtain estimates for national populations and the spatial distribution of the species. These estimates are used to develop a map of where and when these populations are present, and to assess how much uncertainty in their spatial distribution would be present in the region under different policy-relevant conditions. Our results illustrate how these kinds of maps could be produced in the near future, and how they can be used to guide public health policies."

The Bt toxin exhibited increased virulence against larval and adult Ae. albopictus, and increased fecundity of Ae. mosquitoes. Our study demonstrated that the virulence of B. bassiana against mosquitoes can be significantly improved by introducing the Bt toxin gene Cyt2Ba into the genome of the fungus. The transgenic strain Bb-Cyt2Ba significantly reduced the survival and fecundity of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus compared with the WT strain, which suggested that this recombinant B. bassiana has great potential for use in mosquito control."

These parasites possess a stress response mechanism, the spliced leader RNA silencing ( SLS ) pathway, which elicits the transcriptional shut-off of all mRNAs. The mechanism of induction is based on differential stabilization of mRNAs. SLS induces ER stress, which leads to ER lysis and up-regulation of the mRNA, similar to the response to the stress in eukaryotic cells. ER stress induces SLS, which in turn elicits the transcriptional down-regulation of mRNAs that are required for the response. This response is dependent on differential stabilization of mRNAs. The transcriptome changes are accompanied by ER stress and are dependent on the transcription factor tSNAP42. The transcription factor tSNAP42 is then recruited to the ER membrane, where it stabilizes ER mRNA. Prolonged ER stress elicits SLS, and silencing of components of the SLS pathway, including SEC63, a factor that participates in protein translocation across the ER membrane, or SEC61, the translocation channel, also induces SLS. Silencing of these genes or prolonged ER stress leads to programmed cell death ( PCD ), a death pathway observed in higher eukaryotes. We propose that prolonged ER stress induces SLS, which serves as a unique death pathway, replacing the caspase-mediated PCD observed in higher eukaryotes."

C. parvum infection activated NF-\u03baB signaling and upregulation of the miR-27b gene. Meanwhile, downregulation of KSRP was detected in epithelial cells following C. parvum infection. miR-27b targeted the 3\u2032-untranslated region of KSRP, resulting in translational suppression. Forced expression of KSRP and inhibition of miR-27b resulted in an increased burden of C. parvum infection.

We used a novel approach, based on the idea that the brain has a limited amount of connectivity, to model abnormal oscillations in the brain.

We then used these models to examine the neural basis of beta oscillations in PD. We found that abnormal oscillations in the brain were associated with increased connectivity in the pathway from cortex to STN and decreased connectivity from STN to GPe. Moreover, we found that abnormal oscillations in PD are mediated by a specific type of input-output relationship.

To avoid being infected, the host must kill pathogens in the phagosome before they can escape or establish a survival niche. Here, we investigate the role of the phosphoinositide 5-kinase PI ( 3, 5 ) 2 ) in phagosome maturation and killing, using the amoeba and model phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum. We show that PI ( 3, 5 ) 2 is required during early phagosome maturation in Dictyostelium. In the absence of PI ( 3, 5 ) 2, cells are unable to acidify newly formed phagosomes and digest their contents. Consequently, PI ( 3, 5 ) 2 is not able to produce the molecules required for full antimicrobial activity and kills bacteria by inducing proteases and by controlling the entry of Legionella pneumophila. We conclude that PI ( 3, 5 ) 2 is a key factor in early phagosome maturation and that it is important for the host to resist infection by intracellular pathogens."

We have used this method to identify a genetic pathway that is required for apoptosis-induced proliferation. Our results highlight that the signaling pathways downstream of the Wnt and BMP pathways are required for apoptosis-induced proliferation.

One such toxin, Shiga-like protein ( SHP ), is found in the ribosome, a macromolecule responsible for protein synthesis, and in some organisms is involved in protection against parasitic wasps and nematodes. We found that a ribosome-inactivating protein from the Drosophila fruit fly, and a related protein from the wasp and nematode L. boulardi, are involved in protection against parasitic wasps and nematodes. We also show that the genome of D. neotestacea, a wasp that does not protect its host against parasitic wasps, encodes a diverse repertoire of SHP genes. These findings may provide insights into the evolution of toxin repertoires, and may help to explain why certain symbionts protect some hosts more strongly than others."

Some studies have found that the parental species are more polymorphic than the self-fertilizing species. But because the two subgenomes share some of the same genes and functions, the question arises whether the two subgenomes have similar impacts on the expression of genes. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the genomes and the transcriptomes ( three tissues ) of an allopolyploid seed C. bursa-pastonis, the self-fertilizing C. orientalis, and a self-fertile C. grandiflora. Comparison of the divergence in expression between subgenomes, on the one hand, and divergence in expression between the parental species, on the other hand, indicated that the parental species have largely conserved expression patterns and cis-regulation. However, a large proportion of the genes that were differentially expressed between the two subgenomes, were also under trans-regulation. Parental dominance varied among tissues, and expression of the C. orientalis subgenome was closer to that of C. grandiflora. Our results indicate that expression changes could be adaptive and related to the selfing syndrome, while biases in the roots and leaves towards C. orientalis may be reflective of the differential genetic load."

This study aimed to investigate the immunological basis of immune alterations during early O. tsutsugamushi infection in a panel of immune regulators.

We found that CIN is associated with every patient evaluated and further show that many samples exhibit a large degree of nuclear size and CIN value heterogeneity. Furthermore, we show that CIN is dynamic and generally increases within resistant disease. Finally, we show that drug resistance models exhibit remarkably similar levels of CIN, as the nuclear areas and CS values are largely overlapping between the corresponding paired lines.

Here we investigate the role of a particular polarity field in the control of organ development by analysing the development of Arabidopsis petals and comparing it to the results from models of leaf development. We show that the polarity field in the developing flower is more similar to the field than the field in the developing seed, and that the hormone auxin plays an important role in controlling the polarity field. Furthermore, we show that JAGGED is a key regulator of the polarity field, which has a direct effect on the extent of the polarity field. By analysing the pattern of auxin-induced clones, we show that auxin-responsive markers such as DR5 have a broader distribution along the distal petal margin, consistent with the broad distal organiser of polarity. By comparing these results with those from studies on leaf development, we show how simple modifications of an underlying developmental system can generate distinct forms, providing flexibility for the evolution of different organ functions."

Recent analysis of transcript and chromatin profiling suggests that DAF-16 regulates a large number of genes, many encoding other regulatory proteins. We have investigated the regulation by DAF-16 of genes encoding the AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ), which has \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits. C. elegans has 5 genes encoding putative AMP-binding regulatory \u03b3 subunits, aakg-1-5. aakg-4 and aakg-5 are closely related, and they encode the same metabolic regulatory subunits. We show that DAF-16 directly activates expression of aakg-4, which in turn decreases activation of the AMPK subunit. This implies that AMP-independent AMPK activity slows aging in daf-2 mutants. Knock down of aakg-4 expression caused a transient decrease in activation of expression in multiple DAF-16 target genes. This, taken together with previous evidence that AMPK promotes DAF-16 activity, suggests that activation of AMPK subunits in mammals may be evolutionarily conserved."

Among the T3SS-secreted effectors, NleC, a metalloprotease, is known to specifically block NF-\u03baB signaling in host cells, but how NleC does this is unclear. We show that NleC targets p65/RelA through an interaction with a unique N-terminal sequence in p65. Moreover, the NleC-mediated p65 cleavage impacts the expression of a subset of NF-\u03baB target genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, immune cell infiltration in the colon, and tissue injury in C. rodentium-infected mice.

To systematically address this issue, we have established an approach to rapidly access the translational status of each mRNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by affinity purification of endogenously formed ribosomes and the analysis of associated mRNAs with DNA microarrays. Using this method, we compared changes in total mRNA levels ( transcriptome ) with ribosome associations ( translatome ) after the application of different conditions of cellular stress. We found that cellular stress-induced differences in mRNA levels and protein levels affect approximately 15% of total RNA levels. Many of the regulated messages code for functionally related proteins, thus reflecting logical responses to the particular stress. In contrast, mild stress provoked by addition of Calcofluor-white and menadione altered the translatome of approximately 1% of messages with only marginal effects on total mRNA, suggesting uncorrelated responses of transcriptome and translatome. Among these putative translationally regulated messages were most components of the mitochondrial ATPase.

We also find that the striatal microcircuit is very resistant to noise, because a large number of neurons are needed to form the network structure. We show that the network structure is determined by a combination of synaptic connectivity patterns and the dendritic distance between the neurons. This study shows how combining network structure information with knowledge of the network architecture can provide insight into the function of complex structures."

These viruses are often carried by the intestinal tract and colonize the host microbiota. A major challenge for these viruses is to establish a persistent infection in the host, i. e. to remain in the presence of the host microbiota. Mammalian orthoreovirus is an enteric virus that infects humans during childhood. Mammalian orthoreovirus reovirus particles are negatively affected by antibiotic treatment, and this is thought to be a consequence of the host immune response. In this study, we show that reovirus virions interact with and enhance the stability of the viral envelope component LPS and PG. These bacterial envelope components also enhanced reovirus infection of cells following an environmental insult. Our data suggest that bacteria enhance reovirus infection by enhancing the thermal stability of the reovirus particle at a variety of temperatures through interactions between the viral particle and bacterial envelope components."

If treatment does not work well, then cysts are often treated poorly, and the patient will suffer from relapse, i. e., the return of the cyst to its inactive stage. The watch & wait group treated 223 patients of a national clinical center for echinococcosis. We followed them up every three years to assess the stability of the inactive cysts and to see if they respond to benzimidazole treatment. We found that cysts which inactivated through a natural course do not relapse with very high likelihood. We recommend follow-up of 5 years to confirm the stability of the inactive cysts."

This process is thought to be an important determinant of evolutionary fitness, because the longevity of an organism's ability to survive and reproduce depends on its ability to age. Studies of aging in model organisms such as the worm C. elegans have identified many genes and environmental factors that affect lifespan. However, the mechanisms that control reproductive aging are poorly understood. We used this information to investigate the effects of a variety of nutritional and pharmacological factors on reproductive aging. We found that reducing the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in the worm can delay reproductive aging. Cold temperature delayed reproductive aging. The anticonvulsant medicine ethosuximide, which affects neural activity, delayed reproductive aging. Some of these factors decrease early progeny production, but there is no consistent relationship between early reproduction and reproductive aging in strains with an extended lifespan. Our results indicate that reproductive aging is not controlled by use-dependent mechanisms, and that it is not influenced by the environment. This is important for understanding evolutionary theories of aging."

We compared diarrhoea rates between children who received multi-nutrients with and without giardiasis, and we assessed how the effects of these interventions on these children differed. We found that Giardia infection at baseline was associated with a substantial reduction in the rate of diarrhea and fever without localizing signs, whereas no such effect was observed among children who received multi-nutrients. This interaction was independent of age, HAZ-scores, distance to the research dispensary, and the presence of diarrhoea.

To this end, we sequenced a panel of more than 15 million autosomal SNPs from re-sequencing of 43 Fleck\u00f6vers and identified 106 candidate selection regions, many of which are harboring genes related to phenotypes relevant in domestication. We further investigate the relationship between genes with signatures of selection and genes identified in genome wide association studies. Our results demonstrate that regions associated with coat colorful significantly overlap with the candidate selection regions, suggesting that the selection signals we identify are associated with traits that are affected by selection during domestication.

Here we investigate the genetic variation in APL1 at the whole-genome level in the mosquito vector of the malaria parasite, Anopheles gambiae.

Two resistant Trypanosoma brucei lines were generated ( ISMR1 and ISMR15 ), which retained their ability to grow in vitro and establish an infection in mice. Considerable cross-resistance was shown to ethidium bromide and diminazene, with minor cross-resistance to pentamidine. The mitochondrial membrane potential of both resistant cell lines was significantly reduced, and the net uptake rate was reduced 2-3-fold. Fluorescence microscopy and PCR analysis revealed that ISMR1 and ISMR15 had completely lost their kinetoplast DNA ( kDNA ), and both lines carried a mutation in the nuclearly encoded F1 ATPase gene. The mutation compensated for the loss of the kinetoplast in bloodstream forms, allowing near-normal growth, and conferred considerable resistance to isometamidium and ethidium as well as significant resistance to at least some diamidine drugs. Sub-lethal exposure to isometamidium gives rise to viable but highly resistant trypanosomes that, depending on sub-species, are infective to humans and cross-resistant to at least some diaminidines."

To further define the role of inactivating ATRX mutations in carcinogenesis, we knocked out atrx in our previously reported p53/nf1-deficient zebrafish line that develops malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and gliomas. Complete inactivation of atrx using CRISPR/Cas9 was lethal in developing fish and resulted in an alpha-thalassemia-like phenotype including reduced alpha-globin expression. In p53/nf1-deficient zebrafish neither peripheral nerve sheath tumors nor gliomas showed accelerated onset in atrx+/+/- fish, but these fish developed various tumors that were not observed in their atrx+/+ siblings, including epithelioid sarcoma, angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and rare types of carcinoma.

The three cell states exhibit unique growth and differentiation profiles, and we show that genetic analysis can identify key factors involved in the regulation of each state. We show that activating or repressing these factors can induce switching between all three states. We also demonstrate that induction of a single factor can be used to change the state of a cell from one stable state to another. We also demonstrate that stable differentiation requires the activity of a set of transcription factors, which are themselves themselves controlled by chromatin. Our results provide important insight into how this multi-stable switch operates in unicellular fungi."

Following IAV infection these rpM-deficient mice developed severe diffuse alveolar damage, lethal respiratory compromise, and consequent lethality. Lethal injury in these mice was caused by increased infection of their Type-1 Alveolar Epithelial Cells ( T1AECs ) and subsequent elimination of the infected T1AECs by the adaptive immune response. Further analysis indicated rvM-mediated suppression of the cysteinyl leukotriene pathway genes in T1AECs in vivo and in vitro.

Manipulation of an anti-apoptotic gene BcBIR1 modified fungal response to PCD-inducing conditions. As a consequence, strains with reduced sensitivity to PCD were highly virulent, while strains with over-stimulated PCD were less pathogenic. Similarly, reduced levels of PCD in the fungus were recorded following infection of Arabidopsis mutants that show enhanced susceptibility to B. cinerea.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism involved in the nociception triggered by the venom of P. nigriventer. We used a mouse model of nociception, which was able to be mimicked by injection of P. nigriventer venom. We detected that the venom of P. nigriventer induces a kallikrein-like kinin-generating enzyme activity. This activity is present in the venom, and blockade of the enzymatic activity or the administration of a receptor antagonist for kinin B2 was able to inhibit the nociception induced by P. nigriventer.

In the present study, we evaluated the incidence of SFG rickettsiae infection in humans and equines from rural areas of Urab\u00e1 region. We also evaluated the impact of removing ticks after working outdoors on rickettsial infection. We found that removing ticks after working outdoors is a protective factor for rickettsial infection and that a higher incidence of infection occurred in people who reported fever in the last year. These results showed recent circulation of SFG rickettsiae in areas where previous lethal outbreaks have been reported, supporting the implementation of preventive measures to halt rickettsial transmission in the studied communities."

Each cell type can be thought of as a stem cell, which can proliferate indefinitely to produce any number of cells that can differentiate into any type of cell. When cells lose the ability to proliferate, they become activated to produce more cells, but only some cells can survive. This process, called Wnt signaling, is initiated by the hyperactivation of a transcription factor called Wnt1 in the normal intestinal epithelium. In this study, we show that the transcription cofactors Ebd and erect wing, which are highly conserved from worms to humans, are important for the activation of Wnt1 in the adult intestine. In contrast, Ebd is only required for the hyperactivation of Wnt1 in the normal intestinal epithelium. These findings have implications for the design of new therapeutic strategies, which may be useful for activating Wnt signaling in the human intestine to help treat intestinal cancer."

Our results reveal that EIN3 and ORE1 function as a positive regulator of CCG expression during ethylene-mediated chlorophyll degradation. Strikingly, ORE1, a senescence regulator, could directly bind to its target genes in EMSA and ChIP. In addition, EIN3 and ORE1 promoted NYE1 and PAO expression in an additive manner.

We have previously shown that the majority of T lymphocytes in intravascular infiltrates of cerebral malaria-affected mice express the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Here we investigated the effect of IP-10 blockade in the development of experimental cerebral malaria and the induction of splenic anti-parasite immunity. We found that specific neutralization of IP-10 over the course of infection and genetic deletion of this chemokine in knockout mice protects against cerebral malaria. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that lack of IP-10 during infection significantly reduces the parasitemia. The increased resistance to infection was associated with retention and subsequent expansion of parasite-specific T cells in spleens of infected animals, which appears to be advantageous for the control of parasite burden. Thus, our results demonstrate that modulating homing of immune responses to malaria is critical for reaching a balance between protective immunity and immunopathogenesis."

This finding enabled us to ablate aMTOC formation in acentriolar cells and to perform a detailed genetic analysis of the contribution of aMTOCs to acentriolar mitotic spindle formation. We find that although aMTOCs do not detectably increase the efficiency of acentriolar spindle assembly in somatic fly cells, they are required, however, for robust microtubule array assembly in cells without centrioles that lack microtubule nucleation from around the chromatin. Importantly, aMTOCs are also essential for dynein-dependent acentriolar spindle pole focusing and for robust cell proliferation in the absence of centrioles and HSET/Ncd ( a kinesin essential for acentriolar spindle pole focusing in many systems ). We propose an updated model for acentriolar spindle pole coalescence by the molecular motors Ncd/HSET and dynein in conjunction with aMTOCs."

In particular, it is unclear whether a specific experimental protocol, such as blockade of a specific channel, results in the same experimental outcome as in two different neurons differing by only a small amount of sodium channel. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that the same experimental protocol may lead to drastically different experimental results in almost identical neurons. We show that this prediction is not corroborated by direct experimental recordings. We also show that the same experimental protocol can give qualitatively different results in two different neurons, despite the fact that they have the same underlying mechanism.

Altering the direction and orientation of the sRNA upstream and downstream of the pilE G4-associated promoter, we demonstrate that the promoter mutant can only form the G4 structure when the transcription of the sRNA is initiated.

In this study, we sought to identify genes involved in the response to climate change. We genotyped 73 human genetic variants and found that those that were more common in the population that had the highest prevalence of the disease, were also more common in the group that had the highest prevalence of the disease. We also developed a new method that allowed us to find an excess of genic variants in the region that are not in control groups. Our results indicate that candidate genes for common metabolic disorders may be affected by climate change more than other aspects of environmental variation."

Environmental conditions are known to affect the aging process, and our understanding of how these affect aging and contribute to diseases. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms underlying maternal effects of dietary restriction on the growth and development of the roundworm C. elegans. We show that dietary restriction delays aging and increases progeny size. maternal effects are independent of dietary restriction, and we show that the insulin-like signaling pathway, which is known to regulate longevity, also contributes to progeny growth. We also find that insulin-like signaling can control the growth of progeny in the presence of nutrient stress. We conclude that insulin-like signaling and the insulin-like receptor are part of a shared mechanism to regulate reproduction in response to nutritional stress. Our results provide important insight into how maternal effects can affect aging and suggest that the mechanisms are conserved among species and are likely to be important in disease."

Diagnosis and treatment are usually presumptive owing to the lack of good tests at an initial consultation. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) for typhoid fever diagnosis, an immunoglobulin M lateral flow assay ( IgMFA ), in a remote health centre setting in Cambodia from a healthcare provider perspective. We compared the IgMFA versus clinical diagnosis in a cohort with 1000 children in each arm. The cost included direct medical costs only. We obtained the incremental cost effectiveness ratio ( ICER ), expressed as the difference in costs divided by the difference in the number of treatment successes between the two arms. We also obtained the incremental cost effectiveness ratio to have one additional treatment success per 1000 children. The IgMFA was more costly than the clinical diagnosis, and the cost of the IgMFA was estimated at $5700; therefore, the ICER to have one additional treatment success was estimated at $1579. The key drivers for the ICER were the cost of IgMFA and the prevalence of typhoid fever or multi-drug resistant strains."

Loss of G9a function in Drosophila leads to increased sensitivity to RNA virus infection and rapid death.

We show that loss of CKIP-1 causes a loss of phospho-Smad 1/5/8, a key signaling component in neural crest induction. Consistently, loss of Smurf1 has no effect on Wnt signaling. Further experiments show that loss of CKIP-1 causes a reduction in Smurf1-mediated degradation of Smads.

In rab-2 mutants, specific cargo is lost from maturing DCVs and missorted into the endosomal/lysosomal degradation pathway.

For example, a large number of grants are funded by science institutions that are often neglected by these organizations. Yet, a number of studies show that such grants are not the foci that funding agencies should support, but instead are used by the funder to screen for the most promising research ideas. Consequently, some of the funding program's impact on science is squkered because applying researchers must spend time writing proposals instead of doing science. Here we compare how efficient grant proposal competitions advance science, and find that the effort researchers waste in writing proposals may be comparable to the total scientific value of the research that the funding supports, especially when only a few proposals can be funded. Furthermore, when professional pressures motivate investigators to seek funding for reasons that extend beyond the value of the proposed science ( e. g., promotion, prestige ), the entire program can actually hamper scientific progress when the number of winnings is small. We suggest that lost efficiency may be restored either by partial lotteries for funding or by funding researchers based on past scientific success instead of proposals for future work."

It must be present in a cell and acquired via a process called DNA uptake, DNA transfer via cell-to-cell contact, and DNA conjugation. DNA transjugation is a process that transfers DNA directly from one cell to another, allowing it to take up DNA from the donor cell. The process is well known in many bacteria, and it has been proposed that it may also occur in thermophilus bacteria, which have adapted to life on solid surfaces. The current work is the first to show that T. thermophilus TdtA, a protein with no homology to any other DNA translocases, is required for DNA transfer but not DNA cutting. TdtA was found to be required for DNA uptake but not for DNA cutting. We also found that TdtA is required for DNA transjugation, but not for DNA DNA cutting. Our results support that TdtA is a new type of Integrative and Conjugative Element, which promotes the generalized and efficient transfer of genetic traits that could facilitate its co-selection among bacterial populations."

Here, we identified a loss-of-function mutation in CLCC1 in eight families of Pakistani descent. This mutation results in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in the retinal epithelium of the eye. The mutant protein is a predicted intracellular chloride channel, and the loss of function mutation causes a reduction in the function of CLCC1 and a loss of retinal cell electroretinogram. The mutant phenotype is also observed in a model system of zebrafish, indicating that CLCC1 is involved in maintaining retinal cells. Although CLCC1 is a well-known protein for its role in cell signaling, the role of this protein in the retinal cells has been difficult to study due to the lack of a functional model in zebrafish. Our results suggest that mutations in CLCC1 may be responsible for the autosomal recessive form of RP."

We also showed that ICP0 and Ubl2 bind to the same site in a cell-cycle arrest mutant of GMPS, another important cellular protein.

Moreover, we demonstrate hypermethylation of the orthologous X-linked AFF3 promoter, an important prediction of FRAXE ID. cSNP analysis indicates monoallelic expression of the AFF3 gene in FRAX2A carriers thus predicting that FRAXE ID is caused by an increase in the level of the FOXO protein.

Inferences of species history are generally based on phylogenetic comparisons, which assume that molecular evolution is clock-like. In this study, we directly estimated the mtDNA mutation rate by scanning the mitochondrial genome of Drosophila melanogaster lines that had undergone approximately 200 generations of spontaneous mutation accumulation ( MA ). We detected a total of 28 point mutations and eight insertion-deletion ( indel ) mutations, yielding an estimate for the single-nucleotide mutation rate of 6. 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 per site per fly generation. Most mutations were heteroplasmic within a line, and their frequency distribution suggests that the effective number of mitochondrial genomes transmitted per female per generation is about 30. We observed repeated occurrences of some indel mutations, suggesting that indel mutational hotspots are common. Among the point mutations, there is a large excess of G\u2192A mutations on the major strand ( the sense strand for the majority of mitochondrial genes ). These mutations tend to occur at nonsynonymous sites of protein-coding genes, and are expected to be deleterious, so do not become fixed between species. The overall mtDNA mutation rate per base pair per fly generation is estimated to be about 10\u00d7 higher than the nuclear mutation rate, but the mitochondrial major strand G\u2192A mutation rate is about 70\u00d7 higher than the nuclear rate. Silent sites are substantially more strongly biased towards A and T than nonsynonymous sites, consistent with the extreme mutation bias towards A+T. Trait selection therefore maintains specific nonsynonymous bases to maintain specific species-specific bases in each generation."

Three congenic mice containing CAST/Ei regions of chromosome 11 were identified that displayed a rapid inflammatory response to LT similar to, but more severe than that driven by a LT-responsive allele of the inflammasome constituent NRLP1B. Importantly, increased response to LT in congenic mice correlated with greater resistance to infection by the Sterne strain of B. anthracis. The genomic region controlling the inflammatory response to LT was mapped to 66. 36\u201374. 67 Mb on chromosome 11, a region that encodes the LT-responsive CAST/Ei allele of Nlrp1b. Further, the exacerbated response in congenic mice is inherited in a recessive manner while the Nlrp1b-mediated response to LT is dominant. Finally, congenic mice displayed increased responsiveness in a model of sepsis compared with B6 mice. These data suggest that allelic variation of one or more chromosome 11 genes in addition to Nlrp1b controls the severity of host response to multiple inflammatory stimuli and contributes to resistance to B. anthracis Sterne."

The interaction between infected red blood cells and infected red blood cells, the erythrocytes, is a crucial stage of the life cycle of the parasite and is crucial for the development of severe malaria. One of the most important aspects of the erythrocyte interaction is how the parasite interacts with the red blood cell and escapes the red blood cell from the circulation of the body. The interaction between the parasite and the red blood cell has been shown to be mediated by the cytoadhesion of the parasite to the red blood cell receptor, gC1qR. In this study, we analyzed the interaction between gC1qR and the red blood cell receptor to determine if a specific cytoadhesion to gC1qR is involved in severe malaria. Our results show that gC1qR interacts with the red blood cell receptor through surface residues in the cytoadhesion region.

To determine their roles in development and plant infection processes, we functionally characterized all seven ChS genes in Magnaporthe oryzae. Three of them, CHS1, CHS6, and CHS7, were found to be important for plant infection. Most chs1 and chs7 mutants were significantly reduced in virulence. CHS1 plays a specific role in conidium development, an essential step for plant infection. Most chs1 conidia had no septum and spore tip mucilage. CHS1 is also involved in hyphal growth and conidiation. Although deletion of CHS5 had no detectable phenotype, the chs5 chs6 double mutant had more severe defects than the chs6 mutant, indicating that they may have overlapping functions in maintaining polarized growth in vegetative and invasive hyphae. CHS7 has a unique function in appressorium formation. We found that it was blocked in appressorium formation by artificial hydrophobic surfaces. Overall, our results indicate that individual chitin synthase genes play diverse roles in hyphal growth, conidogenesis, appressorium development, and plant infection processes in M. oryzae."

Y. pestis is considered a potential bioweapon, and its rapid lethality and potential bioterrorism attack make it an attractive public health priority. The recent success of aerosol delivery of lethal Y. pestis infection has highlighted the need for better treatment approaches. In this study, we tested the ability of the commonly used anti-uremicronal antibiotic levofloxacin to cure African Green Monkey ( AGM ) nonhuman primate pneumonic plague. We demonstrated that a \u201chumanized\u201d dose of levofloxacin is effective in treating infected animals. We also showed that the administration of this drug to infected animals after the onset of fever in the lethal aerosol-challenged AGM nonhuman primate model is effective at curing the bacteremia that develops during the first 2 days of infusions. The use of a \u201chumanized\u201d dose of levofloxacin may be considered for use in other forms of plague, particularly in bioterrorism scenarios."

In this work, we used the intestinal helminth Echinostoma caproni, a rodent parasite and a model for human helminth, to investigate the role of the humoral immune response on helminth infections. We showed that antibodies are unable to bind to E. caproni surface proteins in vitro. Instead, the antibodies bind to the surface of the parasite in vivo, preventing its killing. We also showed that the surface proteins are degraded by parasite-encoded proteases, preventing their continued entrapment by antibodies. This mechanism of immune evasion may contribute to explain the limited effect of antibody-mediated killing against helminths."

In this study, we created a new strain of S. aureus with high levels of methicillin resistance ( MRSA-MRSA ) and demonstrated that the strain was more attenuated in a mouse model of device infection. This new strain was also more susceptible to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.

However, cohesin and associated factors have additional functions in transcription, DNA damage repair, and chromosome condensation. The human cohesinopathy diseases are thought to stem not from defects in chromosome segregation but from gene expression. We show that the cohesinopathy mutations eco1-W216G and smc1-Q498\u0394 are associated with defects in ribosome biogenesis and a reduction in the actively translating fraction of ribosomes. Metabolic labeling shows that the eco1-W216G and smc1-Q498\u0394 mutants produce less ribosomal RNA, which is expected to constrain ribosome biogenesis. Further analysis shows that the production of rRNA from an individual repeat is reduced while copy number remains unchanged. Similar defects in rRNA production and protein translation are observed in a human Roberts syndrome cell line. In addition, cohesion is defective specifically at the rDNA locus in the eco1-W216G mutant, as has been previously reported for Roberts syndrome. Collectively, our data suggest that cohesin proteins promote production of ribosomal RNA and protein translation, and this is one way they can influence gene expression."

We propose that microtubules are ancestral tubulins that originated from the first eukaryotic tubulin. Microtubules are thus much like bacteria than eukaryotic tubulins.

We used precise methods of enumeration and in vivo labeling with 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine to track recently dividing pDC in blood and tissue compartments of monkeys with acute simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) infection. We show that pDC are lost from blood and peripheral lymph nodes within 14 days of infection, despite a normal frequency of pDC in bone marrow. Paradoxically, pDC loss masked a highly dynamic response characterized by rapid pDC mobilization into blood and a 10- to 20-fold increase in recruitment to lymph nodes relative to uninfected animals. Within lymph nodes, pDC had increased levels of apoptosis and necrosis, were uniformly activated, and were infected at frequencies similar to CD4+ T cells. Nevertheless, remaining pDC had essentially normal functional responses to stimulation through Toll-like receptor 7, with half of lymph node pDC producing both TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1.

Here, we show that EBNA3C can also induce apoptosis through its interaction with the DNA damage response machinery. Importantly, we show that EBNA3C blocks E2F1-mediated apoptosis in two independent ways: first, it targets p53 and E2F1 simultaneously. Second, it can induce apoptosis through its own DNA-binding domain, which is required for efficient DNA damage induced E2F1-mediated apoptosis. Thus, we show that E2F1 is able to inhibit apoptosis induced by DNA damage in two ways. First, it does so through its DNA-binding domain, which is necessary for its DNA damage induced apoptosis. Second, E2F1, which is induced by DNA damage, can represses its own DNA-binding domain, which is crucial for DNA damage induced apoptosis.

For example, a small proportion of Zika virus infections are transmitted by a mosquito, and a large proportion are transmitted by a human. Controlling an infectious disease outbreak requires characterizing the risk associated with multiple transmission routes. Because many pathogens are transmitted via multiple routes, controlling the ZIKV outbreak would require characterizing the risk associated with multiple transmission routes. We developed a novel mathematical approach that accurately characterizes the risk associated with multiple transmission routes. We found that the risk associated with sustained sexual transmission by a mosquito, such as the risk associated with ZIKV, could be substantially higher than the risk associated with small droplet aerosol.

In this study, we examined the role of inflammatory responses following HIV or HCV stimulation of macrophages and Kupffer cells ( KCs ), that may contribute to virus mediated inflammation and subsequent liver disease. We found that KCs upregulate several innate immune signaling pathways that are involved in inflammation, myeloid cell maturation, stellate cell activation, and Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 1 ( TREM1 ) signaling. TREM1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors and is reported to be involved in systemic inflammatory responses due to its ability to amplify activation of host defense signaling pathways. Our data demonstrate that stimulation of KCs with HIV or HCV induces the upregulation of TREM1. Additionally, HIV viral proteins can upregulate expression of TREM1 mRNA through NFkB signaling. Finally, HIV and HCV infected patients exhibit higher expression and frequency of TREM1 and CD68 positive cells.

We find that the response of different brain areas to the same auditory stimulus is very different: the response of the nucleus, and the response to the auditory stimulus, and the response of the brain to the auditory stimulus. We also show that the response of the nucleus to the auditory stimulus is sensitive to the effect of the auditory stimulus, and we identify the cortical input to this sensory region.

In animal and yeast cells, these processes are mediated by the chromatin environment. Epigenetic silencing is known to be regulated by a variety of proteins implicated in chromatin remodeling. MuDR is an example of such a protein. MuDR moves genes into heterochromatin, and this is thought to be a way to repress gene expression. MuDR is also known to be associated with the reversal of previously established epigenetic marks. However, there are no documented examples of MuDR-mediated silencing in plants. MuDR is known to be a naturally occurring, heritable mutation. We have identified a long hairpin RNA molecule that can trigger DNA methylation and heritable silencing of MuDR. This mutation is not associated with changes in the DNA sequence but is instead associated with a change in gene activity. The fact that MuDR can induce heritable changes in gene activity is unexpected. This raises the interesting possibility that local chromatin environments may be the capacity to erase previously established epigenetic marks."

This is achieved through a unique process known as sister chromatid cohesion, in which the sister chromatids that are held in pairs at a particular site in the cell cycle ( the centromere ) are held together by a protein complex called cohesin. Cohesin is present on chromosomes and localizes to regions that are distinct from the centromeric region. However, it is unclear if there is any functional importance in this \u201cjunk\u201d DNA, or if it is merely a consequence of the fact that sister chromatids are not in close proximity to each other in these regions. Here we have analyzed chromosomes of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and found that cohesin is indeed enriched at sites that are distinct from the centromeric region, but that cohesin is not enriched at these sites. The enrichment of cohesin at these sites is dependent on the presence of a special protein, cohesin loading factor ( Nipped-B ). Nipped-B is required for cohesin to accumulate at these sites, and as a result, chromosomes containing ectopic Nipped-B are more prone to break and to recombine. Our results provide evidence that long stretches of heterochromatin distant from the centromere are sufficient to induce chromosome translocations that can be used to inhibit chromosome segregation."

In addition, we show that antifilarial chemotherapy, which is used to kill the adult worms, also reduces the expression of TLR2 and TLR9 in these individuals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that individuals with latent tuberculosis have a diminished TLR2 and TLR9 response compared to those with filarial infection. Finally, we show that treatment of individuals with lymphatic filariasis can significantly reduce the immune response to mycobacteria, and that this immune response is also reduced in those with HIV infection. We conclude that both Mtb and lymphatic filariasis are effective at suppressing TLR-mediated immune responses in latent tuberculosis."

Here, we examined the function of a homolog of the vertebrate POU factor protein, Ventral veins lacking ( Vvl ) /Drvier, in regulating both of these hormonal pathways in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum ( Tenebrionidae ). We found that Vvl plays an important role in regulating both JH and ecdysteroids, as loss of Vvl expression delays the onset of metamorphosis and leads to a prolonged larval stage. We also found that Vvl is involved in the regulation of the JH biosynthesis gene, JH acid methyltransferase 3 ( jhamt3 ), and the expression of the ecdysone biosynthesis gene, hormone receptor 3 ( HR3 ). We also found that Vvl is involved in the regulation of ecdysone and the expression of the ecdysone biosynthesis gene, which is also involved in molting.

An important question in iron homeostasis is how macrophages detect and respond to iron. Iron is often released from the cell as iron particles that are released into the blood circulation. Thus, a current model of iron release is that the body's iron release is a passive process with diffusion of iron particles through the plasma membrane. Iron is oxidized by an enzyme, ceruloplasmin ( Cp ), which oxidizes iron to form mono-ferric and di-ferric transferrin. According to the passive-gradient model, the removal of iron particles from the site of release sustains the iron release. Subcellular localization of Cp, however, indicates that the role of Cp may be more complex. By experiments and mathematical modeling, we have investigated the detailed mechanism of iron release from macrophages focusing on the roles of Cp, FPN and apo-Tf. The passive-gradient model cannot explain macrophage iron release. However, a facilitated-transport model associated with FPN can correctly predict cellular iron efflux and is essential for physiologically relevant whole-body model of iron metabolism."

Our results indicate that, under broad conditions, recombination occurring between members of the same species can accelerate the rate at which a population adapts to environmental conditions. Under more restricted conditions, the density- and frequency-dependent nature of recombination increases the rate of adaptive evolution, and selection for higher rates of adaptive evolution will maintain bacteria-encoded mechanisms for recombination and prevent invasion of non-recombining populations, even when recombination engenders a modest fitness cost.

Inhibition of host cell metabolism that resulted in aberrant intracellular chlamydial inclusion morphology completely abrogated the \u03c42-NAD ( P ) H increase inside the chlamydial inclusion. \u03c42-NAD ( P ) H also decreased inside chlamydial inclusions when the cells were treated with IFN\u03b3 reflecting the reduced metabolism of persistent chlamydiae. Furthermore, a significant increase in \u03c42-NAD ( P ) H and a decrease in the relative amount of free NAD ( P ) H inside the host cell nucleus indicated cellular starvation during intracellular chlamydial infection. Using FLIM analysis by two-photon microscopy we could visualize for the first time metabolic pathogen-host interactions during intracellular chlamydial infection with high spatial and temporal resolution in living cells. Our findings suggest that intracellular chlamydial metabolism is directly linked to cellular NAD ( P ) H signaling pathways that are involved in host cell survival and longevity."

Social interactions between individuals can influence the patterns of spreading, but techniques that allow to collect social information from sensors are still very different from the ones used in numerical models. We first show how these differences affect the prediction of the epidemic risk when social information is available: low participation rate, under-reporting of contacts and overestimation of contact durations in contact diaries. These results show that contact networks constructed from social information and sensors can be used to estimate the epidemic risk, and we propose several methods to use this information in a number of scenarios. We then compare several methods, and show that one of them is able to perform the same estimation as the one proposed by public data sources."

It is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania, and is transmitted by the bite of an infected sand fly. Drugs currently available to treat visceral leishmaniasis are toxic, expensive, difficult to administer, and subject to resistance. The development of new drugs with improved potency and safety is therefore a priority. Drug discovery pipelines for the \u201cneglected diseases\u201d are now heavily populated with nitroheterocyclic compounds. Recently, theibreclic nitro-compounds ( R ) -PA-824, DNDI-VL-2098 and delamanid have been identified as potential candidates for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. Using a combination of quantitative proteomics and whole genome sequencing of susceptible and drug-resistant parasites we identified a putative NAD ( P ) H oxidase, NTR2, as the activating nitroreductase ( NTR2 ). We demonstrate that NTR2 is necessary and sufficient for activation of these bicyclic nitro-drugs. This is the first report of anti-leishmanial nitro-drugs with independent modes of activation and independent mechanisms of resistance."

It is caused by mutations in the Xeroderma pigmentosum ( XPF ) gene, which is essential for nucleotide excision repair ( NER ). NER removes DNA lesions, such as UV\u2013induced photodimers, from the genome. Patients suffering from XP exhibit exquisite sun sensitivity, high incidence of skin cancer, and in some cases neurodegeneration. We have investigated the molecular basis of XP by comparing mutations in XPF to mutations in XPF-ERCC1, a structure-specific endonuclease essential for NER. We found that XPF-ERCC1 is abundant in cells from patients with XP, and its levels were reduced in cells from patients with XPF-ERCC1 mutations. Surprisingly, XPF-ERCC1 was detected in the cytoplasm of cells from patients with XPF mutations. This demonstrates that at least part of the DNA repair defect and symptoms associated with mutations in XPF are due to mislocalization of XPF-ERCC1 into the cytoplasm of cells, likely due to protein misfolding. Analysis of patient cells therefore reveals a novel mechanism to potentially regulate a cell's capacity for DNA repair: by manipulating nuclear localization of XPF-ERCC1."

Loss of Zfp423 alters expression of several genes encoding key cilium components, including increased expression of Tulp3. Tulp3 is a direct binding target of Zfp423 and reducing the overexpression of Tulp3 in Zfp423-deficient cells suppresses Smoothened translocation defects. These results define Zfp423 deficiency as a bona fide ciliopathy, acting upstream of Shh signaling, and indicate a mechanism intrinsic to granule cell precursors for the resulting cerebellar hypoplasia."

How the IKK is activated is largely unknown. Using a combination of structural and biochemical approaches, we have determined the structure of human IKK2 ( hIKK2 ) in its active conformation. This structure is similar to that of the related protein in Xenopus, suggesting that the mechanism by which the IKK activates itself is similar. We show that the structural differences between hIKK2 and XIKK2 are not critical for activation of IKK2. Instead, we show that inactivated XIKK2 exhibits a conformation that is more readily accessible to the interaction with its upstream kinase. We propose that this model supports recently published structural data that implicate strand exchange as a critical component of the IKK activation mechanism. Moreover, we demonstrate that this structural difference is critical for the rapid amplification of IKK2 phosphorylation observed even in the absence of any upstream kinase."

In the current study, we show that many of the chromosomal mutations conferring resistance to a single antibiotic can also confer resistance to other antibiotics. This means that, if one of these antibiotic-resistance mutations is already present in the bacterial population, the other can be useful to the bacterial cell if it is advantageous to the bacterial cell if there is no other antibiotic to use. We further show that the interaction between resistance determinants and plasmids can be antagonistic, and that the effect of an antibiotic on a bacterial strain carrying both resistance determinants is dependent on the bacterial strain carrying both determinants.

However, because very little is understood about either the biochemical predispositions of different genomic regions to recombine or what makes some recombinants more viable than others, the sources of the evolutionary and biochemical forces shaping distinctive recombination patterns observed in nature remain obscure. Here we present a detailed analysis of unique recombination events detectable in the DNA-A and DNA-A-like genome components of bipartite and monopartite begomoviruses. We demonstrate both that recombination breakpoint hot- and cold-spots are conserved between the two groups of viruses, and that patterns of sequence exchange amongst the genomes are clearly non-random. Using a computational technique designed to predict structural perturbations in chimaeric proteins, we demonstrate that observed recombination events tend to be less disruptive than sets of simulated ones. Purifying selection acting against natural recombinants expressing improperly folded chimaeric proteins is therefore a major determinant of natural recombination patterns in begomoviruses."

Recent studies have demonstrated that the tumor suppressor protein SDE2 controls DNA replication and cell cycle progression by acting as a molecular glue that holds the DNA strands together until they are all in the correct position. However, the mechanism by which SDE2 regulates DNA replication is not known. In this study, we identify SDE2 as a new factor that is important for DNA replication and cell cycle control. We show that SDE2 is degraded by the CRL4CDT2 ubiquitin E3 ligase in a cell cycle- and DNA damage-dependent manner. In response to DNA replication stress, the proteolysis of SDE2 is induced, which is necessary for the degradation of the protein by the CRL4CDT2 ubiquitin E3 ligase.

We found that two effector proteins, Tir and EspFU, are necessary to stimulate actin assembly in cultured cells. While Tir and EspFU can activate a host factor, the function of the central Tir protein is to promote assembly of a multi-copy repeat region of EspFU that is necessary for actin assembly. Moreover, the repeats activate a protein complex containing N-WASP, a host factor that has been shown to be important for actin assembly. One explanation for this synergy is that simultaneous engagement of multiple N-WASP molecules can enhance its ability to interact with the actin nucleating Arp2/3 complex.

Using a mouse model with the known human brain atlas, we were able to identify two types of co-expressed genes that were significantly enriched with autism genes."

These striking observations have led to a variety of theories to explain the brain as a model of sensory input. However, the nature of this internal model is unclear. One condition that could be highly informative here is Charles Bonnet syndrome ( CBS ), where loss of vision leads to complex, vivid visual hallucinations of objects, people, and whole scenes. CBS could be taken as indication that there is a generative model in the cortex. This work aims to propose a computational model that could capture the relevant aspects of ( hypothetical ) generative processing in the cortex. We argue that a model recently introduced in machine learning, the deep Boltzmann machine ( DBM ), could capture the aspects of CBS. We show how the DBM could make sense of the cortex, and that homeostatic plasticity could make the cortex more robust against e. g. degradation of sensory input. We demonstrate how a wide range of features of CBS can be explained in the model and suggest a potential role for the neuromodulator acetylcholine."

NCC causes significant health and economic costs on people living in endemic areas such as India. Nevertheless, accurate diagnosis using brain imaging remains poorly accessible and too costly in endemic countries. We evaluated the blood gene expression profile of patients with NCC-associated epilepsy, from patients recovered with NCC, between January 2013 and October 2014. We identified 1411 genes differentially expressed in patients with NCC compared to other groups. This analysis identified 733 downregulated genes in patients with NCC. We also assessed the expression of 15 selected genes in 15 selected patients and found that gene expression was generally higher among patients with NCC, followed by patients with single cyst granulomas, followed by single calcifications. Expression of certain genes in blood monocytes can distinguish patients with neurocysticercosis from patients with idiopathic epilepsy and headaches. These findings are significant because they may lead to the development of new tools to screen for and monitor NCC patients without brain imaging."

We performed genome-wide transcriptome profiling experiments with liver RNA from wild-type mice, Rev-xB\u03b1 knock-out mice, or REV-ERB\u03b1 overexpressing mice. We concluded that REV-ERB\u03b1 participates in the daily expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein ( SREBP ) target genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. This control is exerted via the cyclic transcription of Insig2, encoding a trans-membrane protein that sequesters SREBP proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes. REV-ERB\u03b1 also participates in the cyclic expression of cholesterol-7\u03b1-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1 ), the rate-limiting enzyme in converting cholesterol to bile acids. Our findings suggest that this control acts via the stimulation of LXR nuclear receptors by cyclically produced oxysterols. In conclusion, our study suggests that rhythmic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism is not only driven by alternating feeding\u2013fasting cycles, but also by REV-ERB\u03b1, a component of the circadian clockwork circuitry."

However, it is very difficult to map the antigen on a large number of possible epitopes. A practical alternative is to use artificial algorithms that predict the antigen at the antigen-antigen interface. Several issues have been reported with the current state-of-the-art approaches such as the small number of potential epitopes, the presence of antibodies against the antigen, and the lack of a clear definition of the antigen-antigen interface. Improper definitions, therefore, lead to many artificial false positive predictions and hence to incorrect low performance values. In this paper, we present a new method that addresses these issues and makes use of recent advances in computational science and analytical science.

Rapid cell death is an effective strategy, but activation of cell death comes at a high cost, as dying cells will no longer be available for defense responses and general metabolic processes. In addition, necrotrophic pathogens that thrive on dead tissue, take advantage of cell death-triggering mechanisms. Mechanisms by which plants solve this conundrum remain described. Here, we identify PSIG1 as a novel plant protein that helps to restrict cell death induction during pathogen infection. We show that PSIG1 is involved in the control of cell death induction by regulating the level of cell death inducer, the cell death-inducing molecule, and the rate of cell death induction. Furthermore, we show that PSIG1 interacts with the smg7-4 mutant allele of psig1, which is an important mutant for the cell death induction. Intriguingly, the psig1 mutants demonstrate enhanced susceptibility to the hemi-biotrophic bacterial pathogen.

In this study, we focused on the properties of ribosomes along the mRNA molecule to determine which properties affect translation rates. We analyzed the properties of ribosomes in mouse embryonic stem cells, and found that their translation rates were directly affected by several factors such as the cellular composition of the tRNA pool, the local mRNA folding and the local charge of amino acids.

Our results thus suggest that the translation speed is affected by the composition of the tRNA pool and the local amino acid folding.

In this study, we have immunised mice with DNA plasmids expressing functionally-inactivated forms of two immunomodulatory molecules expressed by the filarial parasite Litomosoides sigmodontis: the abundant larval transcript-1 ( LsALT ) and cysteine protease inhibitor-2 ( LsCPI ). The mutant proteins enhanced immune responses and led to more leukocyte recruitment to the site of infection than their native forms.

Mice immunised simultaneously against the mutated forms of LsALT and LsCPI eliminated adult parasites faster and consistently reduced peripheral microfilaraemia. A multifactorial analysis of the immune response revealed that protection was strongly correlated with the production of parasite-specific IgG1 and with the numbers of leukocytes present at the site of infection.

While many of these studies focus on the early stages of tumor progression, there is increasing interest in understanding how cells can multiply, proliferate, and differentiate into tumor cells. Recent advances in cell culture and transplantation have led to the discovery that mutations in the JAK2 kinase gene, which is involved in a process called self-renewal, can result in cells acquiring an altered phenotype and proliferate uncontrollably. While it is known that JAK2 mutations cause cancer, it is unclear how JAK2 mutations affect the normal behavior of stem cells. Using a combination of mouse and cell culture approaches, we show that JAK2 mutations do not affect the normal behavior of stem cells, but instead cause cells to proliferate at lower rates and give rise to progenitor cells that have a reduced capacity to proliferate. Our results also suggest that JAK2 mutations may eventually lead to cells acquiring a \u201ccompetent\u201d phenotype and eventually to cells unable to proliferate. Moreover, our data show that the ability of JAK2 mutations to proliferate is dependent on the ability of the cells to divide and give rise to progenitor cells."

A prominent example is the neuronal network which drives our brain activity and is thought to be organized in a way analogous to other complex systems. Indeed, the brain appears to function as a system of noisy oscillators which cause transient activity patterns to emerge. We use a simple mathematical model to show that, depending on the particular parameters of the model, activity patterns emerge in a different way. We show that, different from previous results, our model predicts that the activity of the network oscillators is driven by a nonlinear relation, in good agreement with results obtained from MEG data."

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacterium that causes pneumonia and meningitis, and the immune response to this infection is well documented. However, we know very little about the immunological mechanisms that control the outcome of this infection. Here, we use a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia and show that differences in the immune response to this infection are related to differences in the expression of a specific subset of immune regulatory cells. We demonstrate that the ability of these cells to control infection is dependent on their ability to induce a type of immune response called TGF-\u03b2 signalling, which is known to be important in controlling bacterial infection. Blocking this pathway in mice renders them more susceptible to infection, and we show that this protection is mediated by a TGF-\u03b2-dependent pathway. This study provides important new evidence that TGF-\u03b2 signalling is important for the control of bacterial infection, and suggests that TGF-\u03b2 signalling may be a target for immunotherapy or drug design."

One way to answer this question is to measure the functional similarity between a protein and a gene, but, unfortunately, it is difficult to determine which protein and gene are functionally similar. One way to address this problem is to measure the similarity between the two proteins, and to compare it with the similarity between the two genes. Existing methods used to predict protein function are based on this similarity, and are therefore very likely to miss important aspects of how proteins and genes function. Here, we present a new method that combines information between the two proteins and the genes they are functional. Our method predicts that if a protein and gene are similar, then we expect that the protein and gene will be similar, even if the genes are different. We show that our method can predict function better than existing methods, and that it is consistent with the biological functions of the proteins and genes. Our method sheds new light on how proteins and genes evolve, and suggests that other factors, such as the cellular context, may play an important role in determining the function of a protein and gene."

However, the cost of MDA has to be considered, and the use of IRS to kill the insect vector is feasible. Therefore, there is a need for cost-effective strategies for detecting and eliminating VL cases.

Moreover it was found that for most drug classes the first phase transitions from a faster to a slower decay region before the start of the usual second phase. neither of these effects has been explained to date. We use a mathematical model that incorporates the different stages of the HIV viral life cycle in CD4+ T cells: viral entry, reverse transcription, integration, and viral production, to investigate the intracellular HIV mechanisms responsible for these complex plasma virus decay dynamics. We find differences in the phase IA slope across drug classes arise from a higher death rate of cells when they enter the productively infected stage post-integration, with a half-life of approximately 8 hours in this stage, whereas cells in earlier stages of the infection cycle have half-lives similar to uninfected cells. This implies any immune clearance is predominantly limited to the productive infection stage. We also show that the slowing of phase IA to phase IB at day 2 to 4 of monotherapy, depending on drug class, is a result of new rounds of infection. The level at which this slowing occurs is a better indicator of drug efficacy than the slope of the initial decay."

We propose a model of the system, considering two key parameters: ( 1 ) the probability of acquiring short sequences, and ( 2 ) the effectiveness of these sequences to confer immunity. Our analysis shows that if spacers differ mainly in ease of acquisition or if the probability of acquiring them is sufficiently high, bacteria can either avoid the system altogether, or can adapt to it. We also show that if spacers differ mainly in their effectiveness, the distribution of these sequences will be highly peaked, akin to a \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d scenario.

Protection is dependent upon specific IgG1 antibodies, but passive transfer confers only partial immunity to infection. Furthermore, immune mice show greater cellular infiltration associated with trapping of larvae in the gut wall prior to their maturation. Intra-vital imaging of infected intestinal tissue revealed a four-fold increase in the number of excretory-secretory myeloid cells in vaccinated mice, and the massing of these cells around larvae.

Passive antibody therapy is effective only during early, asymptomatic disease, well before diagnosis is made. If efficient immunotherapy of prion diseases is to be achieved, it is crucial to understand precisely how immune tolerance against the prion protein can be overcome and which effector pathways may delay disease progression. We generated a transgenic mouse that expresses the \u00df-chain of a T cell receptor recognizing a PrP epitope presented by the major histocompatibility complex. The fact that the constraint is applied to only one TCR chain allows adaptation of the other chain according to the presence or absence of tolerogenic PrP. We show that transgene-bearing T cells, pairing with rearranged \u03b1-chains conferring anti-PrP specificity, are systematically eliminated during ontogeny in PrP+ mice, suggesting that precursors with good functional avidity are rare in a normal individual. Second, we show that transgene-bearing T cells with anti-PrP specificity are not suppressed when transferred into PrP+ recipients and proliferate more extensively in a prion-infected host. Finally, such T cells provide protection through a cell-mediated pathway involving IL-4 production. These findings support the idea that cell-mediated immunity in neurodegenerative conditions may not be necessarily detrimental and may even contribute, when properly controlled, to the resolution of pathological processes."

To infer about the effects of natural selection on a population, we need to know how strongly the strength of selection influences the underlying genetic variation. The classic way to infer the strength of selection is to calculate the probability that a neutral site is polymorphic given the frequency and position of the non neutral site at the site and, in addition, to calculate the probability that the neutral site is polymorphic given the frequency and position of the non neutral site. These two approaches have been used, but have not been used in a consistent way. We introduce a new method that is unique in that it infers parameters of distinct modes of natural selection on the genome. We show that our method can be used to distinguish between the contributions of sweeps and other modes of selection around amino acid substitutions and that it allows us to reliably predict the level of neutral diversity at the 1 Mb scale in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Our results suggest a substantial effect of natural selection on protein and gene expression, and allow us to detect evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated regions ( UTRs )."

An intriguing hypothesis is that if a cell experiences stress, such as stress elicited by inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum expansion, or misfolded proteins, then subcellular barriers will be less effective at preventing viral infection. We have used a cell culture model to show that the presence of misfolded proteins increases susceptibility to adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) infection. We show that AAV is an order of magnitude more efficient at transducing cells expressing \u0394F508-CFTR than in cells expressing wild-type CFTR. Rescue of misfolded \u0394F508-CFTR under low temperature conditions restored viral transduction efficiency to that demonstrated in controls. We have also shown that the presence of misfolded proteins does not affect cell surface attachment of virus or influence expression levels from promoter transgene cassettes. Thus, we surmised that factors enroll to process misfolded proteins such as \u0394F508-CFTR in the secretory pathway also act to restrict viral infection. We have shown that AAV trafficked to the microtubule-organizing center and localized near Golgi/ER transport proteins. Moreover, AAV infection efficiency could be modulated with siRNA-mediated knockdown of proteins involved in processing \u0394F508-CFTR or sorting retrograde cargo from the Golgi and ER ( calnexin, KDEL-R, \u03b2-COP, and PSMB3 ). In summary, our data support a model where AAV exploits a compromised secretory system and, importantly, underscore the gravity with which a stressed subcellular environment, under internal or external insults, can impact infection efficiency."

HSP is caused by mutations in the gene SPAST, encoding a microtubule ( MT ) -severing protein involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, such as neurite branching, axonal growth, mid-body abscission, and endosomal tubulation. The abnormal accumulation of MTs in axons causes membrane remodeling, including lipid droplets ( LDs ), which can be involved in axon\u2013membrane transport. We now show that spastin-M1 can bind and sort from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to pre- and mature lipid droplets ( LDs ). The ER-resident form of spastin is able to bind and sequester lipid droplets, while arginine 65 to glycine was able to bind and sequester lipid droplets. Consistently, Dspastin overexpression in Drosophila led to bigger and less numerous LDs in the fat bodies and increased triacylglycerol levels. In contrast, Dspastin overexpression increased LD number when expressed specifically in skeletal muscles and nerves. We also found reduced amount of fat stores in intestinal cells of worms in which the spas-1 homologue was deleted. Our data uncovers an evolutionarily conserved role of spastin as a positive regulator of LD metabolism and open up the possibility that dysfunction of LDs may contribute to the pathogenesis of HSP."

Here, we show that a KIN-29 ( SIK ) -dependent chemoreceptor, srh-234, is regulated by integration of sensory and internal feeding state signals. We show that SRH-234 is regulated by insulin-like receptors, DAF-2 and OCR-2, and that DAF-2 and OCR-2 are required for srh-234 expression. While KIN-29 and DAF-16 are known to regulate srh-234 expression in the insulin-like receptor, we show that DAF-16 and its receptor, NPR-1, also regulate srh-234 expression. We also show that sensory inputs from food presence and ADL neural output regulate srh-234 expression.

We show that ADAMTS20 is required for melanoblasts to respond to soluble Kit ligand. We also show that ADAMTS20 can interact with and phosphorylate the protease inhibitor Kit, and that this interaction is required for melanoblast survival. Our data suggest that loss of ADAMTS20 function in melanoblasts results in a failure to respond to a soluble protein ( s pitsulin ), which is expressed in the dermal epidermis and in the thymus, and that this defect can be rescued by a mutation in ADAMTS20. The loss of ADAMTS20 function in melanoblasts results in increased shedding of a protein that is involved in the regulation of blood clotting.

A well-known phenomenon in transcription control is the transition from the transcriptionally inactive to the transcriptionally active state. This process, known as transcription initiation, is often affected by temperature and is therefore a good candidate for the mechanism controlling this cellular process. A well-known example of transcription initiation is the Plac/ara-1 promoter, which is activated at 42\u00b0C and is the main cause for the production of RNA in bacteria. We used time-lapse microscopy to quantify the rate-limiting steps in this process in live E. coli. We found that temperature changes the rate limiting steps of the initiation of the Plac/ara-1 promoter. In addition, we analyzed the PtetA promoter, which is known to be under temperature control and has different rate limiting steps than the Plac/ara-1 promoter. We found that temperature can either decrease the rate limiting steps of the PtetA promoter or increase the rate limiting steps of the Plac/ara-1 promoter. We conclude that different promoters employ different rate limiting step patterns that control not only their rate and variability, but also their sensitivity to environmental changes."

Here we use steered molecular dynamics simulations ( SMD ) to investigate the mechanism of Hsp70 impairment of prions. We demonstrate that DnaK, the ortholog of the human Hsp70 ortholog Ssa1, is predicted to bind substrate more avidly than wild-type DnaK. The larger tryptophan side chain is predicted to cause a conformational change in the peptide-binding domain that physically impairs substrate dissociation. Our analysis fits well with previous yeast genetics studies regarding the functionality of the Ssa1-21 protein and provides further evidence suggesting that manipulation of the Hsp70 ATPase cycle to favor the ADP/substrate-bound form impairs prion propagation. Our computational analysis provides further evidence suggesting that modulation of the ATPase cycle to inhibit substrate dissociation is a critical step in prion propagation."

We demonstrate that, although SOX2 binds a similar motif in the different cell types, its target regions are primarily cell-type-specific and enriched for the distinct binding motifs of appropriately expressed interacting co-factors. Furthermore, SOX2 binding sites can act as cis-regulatory modules capable of directing reporter expression to appropriate tissues in a zebrafish assay. In contrast, SOX2 binding sites found in both endodermal and neural tissues are associated with genes regulating general stem cell features, such as proliferation. Notably, we provide evidence that SOX2 regulates proliferation through conserved mechanisms and target genes in both germ layers examined.

NCC differentiation and survival was impaired in mTOR-deficient mice. We also show that disruption of mTOR caused P53 hyperactivity and cell cycle arrest in cranial NCCs, and lowering P53 activity by one copy reduction attenuated the severity of craniofacial phenotype in NCC-mTOR knockout mice. Importantly, we show that disruption of mTOR leads to NCC-Rptor cell cycle arrest and P53 hyperactivity in part accounts for the craniofacial defects observed in mTOR-deficient NCCs. Our data demonstrate that mTOR functions mediated by mTORC1 are indispensable for multiple processes of NCC development including proliferation, survival, and differentiation during craniofacial development and P53 hyperactivity in part accounts for the defective craniofacial development in NCC-mTOR knockout mice."

However, the exact molecular mechanism by which the integrin transmembrane domains are activated is still unclear. Here, we employ molecular dynamics modeling approaches to investigate the molecular details of the integrin transmembrane domain activation. We find that the transmembrane domains are connected via a membrane-proximal hinge region. The resulting force and energy decrease is sufficient to enable the integrin to cluster, while the protein remains in a non-functional state. If the protein is to regulate integrin clustering, we predict that a high-energy barrier, formed by the transmembrane-cytoplasmic domains, needs to overcome it to allow the protein to cluster. Finally, an outside-in activation-clustering scenario is proposed, explaining how further loading the already-active integrin affects its homo-oligomerization so that focal adhesions grow in size."

In an effort to define the role of PAN RNA in the context of the virus genome we generated a recombinant BACmid that delets the PAN RNA locus. BAC36CR is a recombinant BACmid that removes the duplicated region of PAN RNA. We show that PAN RNA associates with the K-Rta gene promoter and interacts with demethylases JMJD3 and UTX. Consistently, expression of PAN RNA results in a decrease of K-Rta expression, however K-Rta over expression fails to rescue BAC36CR\u0394PAN.

The most common assumption to explain the activity of two factors is that they occupy distinct niches, and that the activity of one factor is inhibited by the other factor. However, we show here that in fact the two factors do not occupy distinct niches but instead share the same set of enhancers. Using a combination of genetic and biochemical methods, we show that the transcription factor Myocyte Enhancer 2 ( Mef2 ) and the zinc-finger transcription factor ttk ( lmd ) are key mediators of the regulation of the activity of one another.

We have characterized meiotic recombination in two different types of sexual reproduction in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, an important opportunistic human fungal pathogen. We found that recombination operates similarly during both sexual reproduction and bisexual reproduction. This suggests that meiotic recombination is a process that is analogous to bisexual reproduction. Additionally, we found evidence that in both sexual reproduction and bisexual reproduction the presence of fragile regions of the genome may be vulnerable to the recombination process.

NS1 binds to vRNP and recruits PKR to the viral RNA sensing complex, which then triggers activation of PKR.

We propose that this is an initial response to stress brought about by the cell cycle that triggers sporulation.

Here, we built a multiscale, morphologically realistic, conductance-based computational model of the pyramidal neuron that accounts for experimental details of electrical and calcium-dependent biochemical signaling. We found that the spatiotemporal spread of the signaling microdomain is regulated by dendritic voltage-gated ion channels. Specifically, the activation of CaMKII ( pCaMKII ), which is the most prominent structural substrate for microdomain physiology, triggered the amplification of the microdomain in phosphorylated CaMKII. Next, we analyzed the role of two dendritic inactivating channels, one restorative ( A-type potassium ) and another regenerative ( T-type calcium ), in regulating microdomains and their spatiotemporal spread. Whereas A-type potassium channels suppressed the spread of pCaMKII microdomains by altering the voltage response to TBS, T-type calcium channels enhanced this spread by modulating TBS-induced calcium influx without changing the voltage. Finally, we explored cross-dependencies of these channels with other model components, and demonstrated the heavy mutual interdependence of several biophysical and biochemical properties in regulating microdomains and their spatiotemporal spread.

We show that the VACV protein A49 binds to and blocks the activation of NF-\u03baB by the cellular factor \u03b2-TrCP. We further show that A49 is able to bind to and block the cellular factor \u03b2-TrCP. Consequently, the expression of A49 is prevented and inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation is blocked. We then demonstrate that this mechanism of immune evasion is conserved in other viral pathogens. Furthermore, A49 is able to block the activation of the cellular factor NF-\u03baB by mutating its ligand binding region. A VACV lacking the A49-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB showed reduced virulence in vivo, indicating that it is an effective vaccine."

This vaccine has been shown to induce an immune response that is able to neutralize the parasite and to protect against disease. However, the use of this vaccine has some drawbacks. For example, it can only protect against the development of a disease in a certain age group and not in all individuals. In this study, we present the results of a new vaccine that can protect against a wide range of Leishmania species. The vaccine was made by combining the three Leishmania infantum poly ( A ) binding proteins ( LiPABP ). LiPABP are conserved proteins from Leishmania, but differ only in the type of the protein they are able to bind ( A/B ). The LiPABP proteins were modified to be able to make DNA vaccines. The use of the vaccine in mice showed that the LiPABP proteins could induce a partial protection against the development of leishmaniasis."

Inactivation of genes encoding protease activation and/or prostase activation components fails to rescue embryonic lethality, suggesting that prostasin is a critical developmental target for both HAI-1 and HAI-2.

The algorithm makes use of dynamic measurements of red blood cell progenitors between embryonic days 12 and 15 in the mouse. It selects for intercellular interactions that reproduce the red blood cell developmental process and endow it with robustness to external perturbations. This analysis predicts that negative autoregulatory interactions arise between early erythroblasts of similar maturation stage. By studying embryos mutant for the death receptor FAS, or for its ligand, FASL, and by measuring the rate of FAS-mediated apoptosis in vivo, we show that FAS and FASL are pivotal negative regulators of fetal erythropoiesis, in the manner predicted by the computational model.

Our framework accounts for a variety of factors that affect the transmission probability and can be used to quantify the effects of selection and the presence of viral lineages.

While extensive research has tried to identify the mechanisms that underpin memory formation, and how they change with learning, it is still unclear how memory is maintained in neuronal networks in vivo. This paper describes a model of calcium-based plasticity which is able to fit different experimental data-sets from hippocampal and neocortical preparations. We find that in the presence of background activity on the order of 1 Hz parameters that fit pyramidal layer 5 neocortical data lead to a very fast decay of synaptic efficacy, with time scales of minutes. We then identify two ways in which this time scale can be extended: ( i ) the extracellular calcium concentration in the experiments used to fit the model are larger than estimated concentrations in vivo. Lowering extracellular calcium concentration to in vivo levels leads to an increase in memory time scales of several orders of magnitude; ( ii ) adding a bistability mechanism so that each synapse has two stable states at sufficiently low background activity leads to a further boost in memory time scales, since memory decay is no longer described by an exponential decay from an initial state, but by an escape from a potential well."

The first layer of the ear is called the ventral placode, which is thought to form the brain. The second layer, the otic vesicle, is thought to form in a similar way, but is not thought to contribute to the formation of the brain. The mechanisms by which the different cell types of the inner ear arise are poorly understood. The zebrafish inner ear is a simple, evolutionarily conserved organ, yet contains more complex structures than the vertebrate ear. We have studied the role of two signalling pathways, FGF and RA signalling, in regulating the development of the zebrafish inner ear. We show that high levels of FGF signalling restricts the expression of the non-neural marker otx1b, which is necessary to establish the primary sensory cell type of the inner ear, the otic neurogenic domain. On the other hand, low levels of RA signalling promote the expression of otx1b and restricts the development of non-neural fates. Our results indicate that FGF and RA signalling are required in the zebrafish inner ear to pattern and establish the primary sensory cell type of the inner ear."

We found that six essential genes are controlled by the Sen1 pathway. In these genes, the termination of transcription is regulated in a similar way to that of the mRNAs that control the expression of other genes. By combining our data with previous studies on the control of transcription of a large number of non-coding RNAs, we identified novel factors that control this process. We also discovered a new role for the Sen1 pathway in repressing genes involved in meiosis, a process that is critical for the formation of eggs and sperm.

Control of schistosomiasis is currently based on treatment with one drug, praziquantel. Praziquantel kills the adult worms, but it is not known the mechanism of action of this drug. Serotonin is an important neuroactive substance in all parasitic helminths, and it is strongly myoactive and stimulates the contraction of the body wall muscles and the motor activity. Here, we provide the first molecular evidence of a functional serotonin receptor in S. mansoni. The schistosome receptor belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) superfamily and is distantly related to serotonergic type 7 ( 5HT7 ) receptors from other species. Functional expression studies in transfected HEK 293 cells showed that the schistosome receptor is a specific serotonin receptor and it signals through an increase in intracellular cAMP, consistent with a 5HT7 signaling mechanism. The parasite is also resistant to exogenous serotonin treatment. The fact that Sm5HTR is abundantly expressed in the worm's nervous system suggests that serotonin stimulates movement via this receptor by modulating neuronal output to the musculature. Together, the evidence identifies Sm5HTR as an important neuronal protein and a key component of the motor control apparatus in S. mansoni."

We show that L* potently inhibits the interferon-induced OAS/RNase L pathway. The inhibition of this antiviral pathway is particularly prominent in macrophages where the basal levels of oligoadenylate synthetase ( OAS ) and RNase L are elevated. L* mutations significantly affected Theiler's virus replication in primary macrophages derived from wild-type but not from RNase L-deficient mice. L* counteracted the OAS/RNase L pathway through direct interaction with the ankyrin domain of RNase L, resulting in the inhibition of this enzyme. Interestingly, RNase L inhibition was species-specific as Theiler's virus L* protein blocked murine RNase L but not human RNase L or RNase L of other mammals or birds. Direct RNase L inhibition by L* and species specificity were confirmed in an in vitro assay performed with purified proteins.

Using Direct Coupling Analysis ( DCA ), we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pin-points structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by inter-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability.

We focused on the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase WWP2, which is a top candidate in the Notch3 interactome list. Our results show that WWP2 interacted with N3-ICD but not with intracellular domains from other Notch receptors.

Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset showed that the majority of ovarian carcinomas harbored homozygous or heterozygous deletions in WWP2 locus, and there was an inverse correlation in the expression levels between WWP2 and Notch3 in ovarian carcinomas. Furthermore, ectopic expression of WWP2 decreased tumor development in a mouse xenograft model and suppressed the Notch3-induced phenotypes including increase in cancer stem cell-like cell population and platinum resistance.

Influenza A virus-induced TLR2 has been shown to induce IFN production in macrophages and dendritic cells, but the mechanism of this effect remains unclear.

IRF-3 is an essential protein for IFN production, and thus, we have defined the role of IRF-3 in IFN induction.

Here, we show that Wnt ligands are expressed in mesenchyme and mesenchyme-associated dermal and osteoblast cells, and they are necessary for the differentiation of the mesenchyme and osteoblast cells. We show that Wnt ligands are required for the formation of a mesenchyme stem cell population, which is capable of initiating a mesenchymal-specific transcription program that drives the formation of osteoblasts. We also show that Wnt ligands are required for the differentiation of osteoblasts and for the formation of a mesenchyme stem cell population. Finally, we show that ectoderm Wnt ligands are not required for mesenchyme development, and they are not required for the differentiation of osteoblasts. Our results suggest that the mesenchyme and osteoblast are two distinct developmental programs that are specified by distinct Wnt ligands."

Here, we report a large-scale analysis of NRL targetome using high-throughput sequencing ( ChIP\u2013Seq ), coupled with global expression profiling and in vivo knockdown studies. We identified 300 direct NRL target genes. Of these, 22 NRL targets are associated with human retinal dystrophies, whereas 95 mapped to regions of as yet uncloned retinal disease loci. Our results demonstrate that genes involved in photoreceptor function include binding sites for both NRL and homeodomain protein CRX. Evaluation of 26 ChIP\u2013Seq regions validated their enhancer functions in reporter assays. In vivo knockdown of 16 NRL target genes resulted in death or abnormal morphology of rod photoreceptors, suggesting their importance in maintaining retinal function. Our results identify candidate genes for retinal dystrophies, define cis-regulatory module ( s ) for photoreceptor-expressed genes and provide a framework for decoding transcriptional regulatory networks that dictate rod homeostasis."

Antibodies are critical for immune recognition, and broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs ) are required to control infection. bnAbs evolve over time, with the rate of change decreasing as the immune response develops. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this slowing are not well understood. We recently found that the rate at which mutations accumulate decreases over time, and that this slowing is due to the evolution of the complementarity determining regions ( CDRs ). In this study, we used next generation sequencing to investigate whether natural selection and/or mutability of the antibody variable region contribute to this slowing. We sampled from 3 donors, as well as from multiple populations, and analyzed the evolutionary rate of the complementarity determining regions, which are most significant for antibody function. We found that evolutionary rates correlate with the Darwinian selection strength, and that the rate of mutability does not change significantly over time. These results show that the rate of mutability change is slow, and that the mutability changes are largely independent of the rate of evolution. These results provide a more complete understanding of HIV-1 evolution and may lead to new therapeutic strategies."

It is therefore important to investigate the interaction between the tubercle bacillus and the host cell that is responsible for the formation of granulomas. We have analyzed the interaction of M. tuberculosis with human macrophages.

BAG3 is hyperphosphorylated at mitotic entry and localizes to centrosomal regions. BAG3 regulates, in an HSPB8-dependent manner, the timely congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate by influencing the three-dimensional positioning of the mitotic spindle. Depletion of BAG3 caused defects in cell rounding at metaphase and dramatic blebbing of the cortex associated with abnormal spindle rotations. Similar defects were observed upon silencing of the autophagic receptor p62/SQSTM1 that contributes to BAG3-mediated selective autophagy pathway. Mitotic cells depleted of BAG3, HSPB8 or p62/SQSTM1 exhibited disorganized actin-rich retraction fibres, which are proposed to guide spindle orientation. Proper spindle positioning was rescued in BAG3-depleted cells upon addition of the lectin concanavalin A, which restores cortex rigidity. Together, our findings suggest the existence of a so-far unrecognized quality control mechanism involving BAG3, HSPB8 and p62/SQSTM1 for accurate remodelling of actin-based mitotic structures that guide spindle orientation."

In Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, the embryo is surrounded by a single cell endosperm layer itself surrounded by a seed coat layer.

Cutin-containing layers are present in seed coats of numerous species, including Arabidopsis, where they regulate permeability to outer compounds. However, the role of cutin in mature seed physiology and germination remains poorly understood. Here we identify in mature seeds a thick cuticular film covering the entire outer surface of the endosperm. This cuticle is defective in cutin-deficient body guard1 seeds, which is associated with alterations in endospermic permeability.

Here, we use an atomistic molecular dynamic analysis to analyze the effect of protein crowding on three proteins: an intrinsically disordered protein, a molten globule conformation, and a one-fold structure. We find that protein crowding does not stabilize the native compact structure, and often prevents structural collapse. Poly ( ethylene glycol ) PEG500 fails to reproduce many aspects of the physiologically-relevant protein crowders, thus indicating its unsuitability to mimic the cell interior. Instead, the impact of protein crowding on the structure and dynamics of a protein depends on its degree of disorder and results from two competing effects: the excluded volume, which favors compact states, and quinary interactions, which favor extended conformers. Thus, the protein crowders used here act as unspecific chaperones that modulate the protein conformational space, thus having relevant consequences for disordered proteins."

In this study we assessed the impact of knowledge, attitudes, and practices ( KAPs ) and social-ecological factors on the presence or absence of DENV infections in the household. We compared KAPs and social-ecological factors between study participants and compared them to other aspects of household-level dengue risk. We also examined associations between dengue and other diseases such as chikungunya fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever, and Zika fever. Our findings indicate that knowledge, attitudes, and practices ( KAPs ) and social-ecosystems are important factors for the household-level risk of DENV infection in the urban setting of Machala, Ecuador. We recommend interventions to decrease the risk of DENV infections in the household, including focusing on household-level vector control, daily garbage collection, and reliable piped water inside the home. These findings can inform the design of interventions to reduce the risk of other diseases transmitted by the Ae. aegypti mosquito, such as chikungunya and Zika fever."

The ability to rapidly change the sequence of mutations that accumulate in infected individuals renders the emergence of multi-drug-resistant forms of HIV a potent force underlying the emergence of new HIV strains that can escape therapy and/or the development of specific immune responses. We present a mathematical model that describes the evolution of recombinant forms of HIV in infected individuals. The model is parameterized on the time evolution of recombination and the proportion of infected cells that are exposed to multiple viral strains. Model predictions capture several recent in vitro experiments and quantify the magnitude of recombination in HIV dynamics. Model predictions are also used to describe the time evolution of recombination in vivo. Our model presents an accurate description of the influence of recombination on HIV dynamics in vitro. When distinctions between different viral genomes are ignored, our model reduces to the standard model of viral dynamics, which successfully predicts viral load changes in HIV patients undergoing therapy. Our model may thus serve as a useful framework to predict the emergence of multi-drug-resistant forms of HIV in infected individuals."

FMRP is induced in synaptone complexes in culture, and DHPG treatment in vivo increased APP translation. We also show that FMRP interacts with APP mRNA, and that this interaction is required for normal APP translation in cultured cells.

We find that the probability of being exposed to the parasite depends on the individual level, the sensitivity of the human immune system, and the variability in the human susceptibility to the parasite. These findings provide the first step toward developing a tool to assess the likelihood of exposure to the parasite in low transmission areas.

This diversity can be naturally explained by the presence of a clonal bursty cell population, and the abundance of clonal cells depends on the number of progenitor cells. This model is most parsimonious about the nature of the clonal bursty cell population dynamics.

Chromosomes consist of a single chromosome end, a telomere, and a highly dynamic complex of proteins, nucleosomes, and other macromolecules. The ends of chromosomes are bound by telomerase, a reverse transcriptase enzyme that binds to the ends of the chromosome ends and promotes the transcription of the chromosome ends. This transcription factor is active only at the ends of the chromosome ends. T ERRA is a highly conserved telomere transcription factor that upregulates at chromosome ends upon experimental manipulation or in ICF ( immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, facial anomalies ) patients. Here we mapped TERRA at chromosome ends and identified the transcriptional start site of TERRA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that TERRA expression in yeast causes short telomeres, but not of other chromosome ends. TERRA interacts with the Exo1-inhibiting Ku70/80 complex, and deletion of Exo1 but not MRE11 fully suppressed the T ERRA\u2013mediated short telomere phenotype in presence and absence of telomerase. Thus TERRA transcription facilitates the 5\u2032-3\u2032 nuclease activity of Exo1 at chromosome ends, providing a means to regulate the telomere shortening rate. We propose that TERRA promotes telomere transcription by modulating the activity of the 5\u2032-3\u2032 nuclease Exo1."

To study the function of SOX11, we have generated zebrafish embryos lacking SOX11, and treated them with the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor cyclopamine to study the role of SOX11 in ocular development. We show that SOX11 is required to maintain specific levels of Hedgehog signaling during ocular development. We also identified two novel heterozygous SOX11 variants in patients with microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma. In contrast to wild type human SOX11 mRNA, containing either variant failed to rescue the lens and coloboma phenotypes of zebrafish. Moreover, decreased gene dosage from a segmental deletion encompassing the SOX11 locus resulted in microphthalmia and related ocular phenotypes. Therefore, our study reveals a novel role for SOX11 in controlling Hedgehog signaling, and suggests that SOX11 variants contribute to pediatric eye disorders."

Currently, there are no effective measures to prevent the disease and, despite availability of antibiotics and surgical treatment, these therapeutic options are often associated with severe side effects. Therefore, it is important to develop alternative strategies for the treatment of BU. Endolysins ( lysins ) are phage-encoded enzymes that degrave peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls. Over the past years, lysins have been emerging as alternative antimicrobial agents against bacterial infections. However, mycobacteria have an unusual outer membrane composed of mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan. To overcome this complex barrier, some mycobacteriophages encode a lipolytic enzyme, Lysin B ( LysB ). In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that recombinant LysB displays lytic activity against M. ulcerans isolates. Moreover, using a mouse model of M. ulcerans footpad infection, we show that subcutaneous treatment with LysB prevented further bacterial proliferation, associated with IFN-\u03b3 and TNF production in the draining lymph node. These findings highlight the potential use of lysins as a novel therapeutic approach against this neglected tropical disease."

The methylation modification seems to be responsible for the decrease in the expression of POMC mRNA. This methylation variant is the first identified in the human genome that is associated with the individual risk for obesity."

        "generated_summary": "APOBEC3G ( A3G ) is a deoxycytidine deaminase that is expressed in human T cells and inhibits HIV-1 replication. When transfected into A3G-deficient epithelial cell lines, A3G induces catastrophic hypermutation by deaminating the HIV-1 genome. Interestingly, studies suggest that endogenous A3G in T cells induces less hypermutation than would be expected. However, to date, the specific deaminase activity of endogenous A3G in human CD4+ T cells has not been examined directly. Here, we have examined the deaminase activity of endogenous and exogenous A3G in various human cell lines. We found that exogenous A3G in epithelial cell lysates displayed deaminase activity only following RNase treatment, as expected given that A3G is known to form an enzymatically inactive RNA-containing complex. Furthermore, RNase-treated T cell lysates conferred a dose-dependent inhibition to epithelial cell lysates expressing enzymatically active A3G. These studies suggest that T cells, unlike epithelial-derived cell lines, express an unidentified RNase-resistant factor that inhibits A3G deaminase activity. This factor could be responsible for reduced levels of hypermutation in T cells, and its identification and blockade could offer a means for increasing antiretroviral intrinsic immunity of T cells."

        "generated_summary": "Streptococcus pneumoniae ( the pneumococcus ), a leading cause of life-threatening illness and death worldwide, is a well-studied model for the study of bacterial pathogens, and is a major model for the development of new vaccines. However, due to the fact that the pathogen can evolve quickly, it is unclear whether or not the existing vaccines can protect against new serotypes. In this paper, we present mathematical models and whole genome analyses of S. pneumoniae to investigate how vaccination can drive the evolution of new serotypes. We find that vaccination can drive changes in metabolic and virulence-associated components of the bacterium. This phenomenon, termed Vaccine-Induced Metabolic Shift ( VIMS ), can be transferred to non-vaccine serotypes through recombination. Our results provide a novel explanation for changes observed in the population structure of the pneumococcus following vaccination, and have important implications for strain-targeted vaccination in a range of infectious disease systems."

        "generated_summary": "Networks of interactions among proteins are networks of physical interactions of proteins and their interactions, and these networks are increasingly being analysed to comprehensively describe the cellular functions of proteins in the cell. While network analysis is increasingly being carried out at the level of individual proteins, network analysis has been limited to characterising interactions between pairs of proteins and interactions between pairs of proteins, as well as interactions between pairs of proteins and their interacting partners. However, these two types of network analysis do not fully describe the dynamics of the system. We show that by incorporating network structure into the analysis, we are able to detect the dynamics of the network in which the interactions are, and also, to examine which network properties are important for determining this dynamics. We show that the network structure is important for determining the dynamics of the network and not only for describing the network but also for determining which network properties are important for describing the dynamics of the network."

Despite their high prevalence, relatively little is known about the epidemiology of these diseases, especially at the household level. This is important, as the risk of these diseases can differ significantly within communities and health districts. We describe a general contextual analysis that uses multi-level spatial models to partition and quantify variation in individual infection risk at multiple grouping levels in rural Kenya. We show that the highest risk of infection is for the gastrointestinal helminths, while the lowest risk is for the HIV, TB and M. tuberculosis. We also show that the spatial clustering of HIV, TB, and M. tuberculosis is greater for the NTDs than for TB and malaria. Our results provide a framework for understanding the complex ecology of these diseases and contribute to the targeting of interventions."

The bacteria colonize the stomach and can cause ulceration, which is one of the most common peptic ulcers. This colonization requires the bacterium to move through the tissue and to enter the gastric epithelium, a cell that lines the stomach. H. pylori is thought to be able to sense the presence of acid in the gastric tissue and to use this information to move within the tissue, however the precise mechanism is still unclear. We have used genetically modified H. pylori to study how H. pylori moves from the gastric tissue to the cell of the stomach. We show that H. pylori preferentially colonizes the ulcerated area, rather than the non-ulcerated tissue. The bacteria also use chemical signals to communicate within the gastric tissue. We show that H. pylori moves rapidly from the gastric tissue to the cell of the stomach, and that this movement is required for H. pylori to inhibit stomach acid accumulation. Our results show that H. pylori is able to sense acid in the gastric tissue, and use this information to to move to the cell of the stomach, and thereby to the gastric epithelium."

HAP2 was shown to be present in all eukaryotes and initiate fusion with host cells via insertion of fusion loops into the host membrane. However, the functional conformation of the HAP2 fusion loops has remained unknown, as the reported X-ray structure of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii HAP2 lacked this critical region. Here, we report a structure-guided alignment that reveals diversification of the proposed HAP2 fusion loops. Our study suggests that HAP2 may have evolved multiple modes of membrane insertion to accommodate the diversity of membrane environments encountered during eukaryotic evolution."

        "generated_summary": "Dengue is a disease that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Infection with dengue virus ( DENV ) causes a broad spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild fever to potentially fatal disease. There is no approved vaccine or antiviral drugs to treat dengue infection. The difference between severe and mild disease appears to be dependent on the amount of DENV in the patient. Diagnosis may enable timely therapeutic intervention to blunt disease severity by reducing the amount of DENV in the patient. Harnessing the therapeutic potential of RNA interference ( RNAi ) to attenuate DENV replication may offer one approach to dengue therapy. We screened the non-translated regions ( NTRs ) of the RNA genomes of representative members of the four DENV serotypes for putative RNA targets mapping to known regulatory elements. We identified a target site in the 5\u2032 NTR that maps to the 5\u2032 upstream AUG region, a highly conserved cis-acting element essential for viral replication. We used a replication-defective human adenovirus vector to deliver a short-hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) targeting this site into cells. We show that this shRNA matures to the cognate siRNA and is able to inhibit effectively antigen secretion, viral RNA replication and infectious virus production by all four DENV serotypes. The data demonstrate the feasibility of using AdV5-mediated delivery of shRNAs targeting conserved sites in the viral genome to effectively inhibit all four DENV serotypes. This paves the way towards exploration of RNAi as a possible therapeutic strategy to curtail DENV infection."

Here, we address the question of what factors determine whether a cell will remain as a stem cell or differentiate into a tissue. We develop mathematical models to investigate how the combination of properties of cellular hierarchy and de-differentiation patterns determine whether a cell will invade a tissue. Our results suggest that de-differentiation is most likely to be favored provided stem cells having the largest effective self-renewal rate. Moreover, jumpwise de-differentiation provides a wider range of favorable conditions than stepwise de-differentiation. Finally, the effect of de-differentiation on the redistribution of self-renewal and differentiation probabilities also greatly influences the selection for de-differentiation."

We have previously shown that one of the most abundant protein in the cuticle of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, is a member of the CPR family. We now show that another member of the CPR family, TcCPR4, is also required for the formation of pore canals and the associated laminae and for the proper formation of the dorsal-ventral and ventral- abdominal axes of the pupae. The TcCPR4 protein is localized in the apical plasma membrane protrusions of the procuticle of rigid adult cuticles, suggesting that TcCPR4 is important for the formation of the vertical pore canals and the laminae."

PhyB ( phyB N651 ) is the major phyB protein that detects light and is bound to the N-terminal domain of phyB ( N651 ). This domain is required for phyB to perceive light, but the N651 subdomain is not. Here, we performed a mutational screen to identify N651 mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana, and we found 14 new mutations in this subdomain. Most of them are located in the N-terminal extension and the PLD, and are involved in light-signal perception. On the other hand, the N-terminal C-terminal GAF and the PLD subdomains are responsible for light perception. Among the signaling mutants, R110Q, G111D, G112D, and R325K were particularly interesting. These observations indicate that the N-terminal extension and PLD are mainly involved in signal transfer, but that the C-terminal GAF and PHY subdomains are responsible for light perception."
