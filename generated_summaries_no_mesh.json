Influenza viruses are divided into two subtypes, termed \u201ctypes I\u201d and \u201ctypes II\u201d. Influenza viruses are classified into type I and II, and they are divided into two subtypes, termed \u201cthe influenza A\u201d and \u201cthe influenza B\u201d. Type I virus is responsible for the most severe form of influenza, and is responsible for the majority of annual influenza deaths in the United States. Influenza A virus is able to elicit an immune response that can protect against both types of influenza viruses. Influenza A virus is also an excellent target for developing an influenza vaccine that can protect against both types of influenza viruses. However, current influenza vaccines elicit only one type of antibody response, and it is unclear how this antibody response could protect against both types of influenza viruses. Here, we show that influenza-specific T lymphocytes and virus-specific non-neutralizing antibodies are not only capable of protecting against type I virus, but also cooperatively elicit protection against influenza viruses. Our studies provide the basis for a potential \u201cuniversal\u201d influenza vaccine that may be able to protect humans against both types of influenza viruses."

Migratory movements can facilitate the dissemination of infectious disease from one region to another and the development of new cases. Past studies have focused on migration in the past 30 years and have focused on migration in the past 40 years. However, leprosy can also occur during the past 20 years, and it is becoming more frequent in Brazil, especially in the West Pacific area. We investigated whether migration patterns and risk factors for leprosy are associated with past 5 year migration in four regions of Marfund, northeastern Brazil, and found that past 5 year migration was associated with leprosy and was significantly associated with the presence of leprosy in the past 5 year migration. We also found that poverty, as well as leprosy contact in the family, household and other leprosy contact, were associated with leprosy among past 5-year migrants in the bivariate analysis. Alcohol consumption was also associated with leprosy, a relevant risk factor in susceptibility to infection that should be explored in future research. Our findings provide insight into migration patterns and risk factors for leprosy in endemic areas with high population mobility."

It is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania and can result in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from localized cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis to fatal visceral disease. A particularly severe form of leishmaniasis, termed mucosal leishmaniasis, exhibits decreased IL-10 levels and an exaggerated inflammatory response that perpetuates the disease. Using a mouse model of leishmaniasis, we investigated what cytokines contribute to increased pathology when IL-10-mediated regulation is absent. We found that IL-17, a cytokine with a known role in modulating the immune response, promoted an increased infiltration of monocytes, while IL-17 contributed to an increased infiltration of neutrophils. Surprisingly, though, we found that IL-17 did not contribute to increased pathology, but instead regulated the IL-17 response. Thus, our results provide new insight into the role of IL-17 in the pathology in the absence of IL-10 regulation. Blocking IL-17, possibly by decreasing IL-1\u03b2 levels, may be a useful approach for controlling immunopathology in leishmaniasis."

We also show that the [PSI+] infectious aggregates increase in size and decrease in transmissibility to daughter cells, and that the Pin4 Q/N-rich domain sequesters Hsp104 and Sis1 chaperones away from the cytoplasmic pool. Thus, a mechanism by which heterologous Q/N-rich proteins impair prion propagation appears to be the loss of cytoplasmic Hsp104 and Sis1 available to sever [PSI+]."

We also show that this tissue-specific imprinting is established independently of Kcnq1ot1 expression, and we identify a novel mechanism that operates to control the level of Kcnq1ot1, which is produced by alternative transcriptional start sites. We also show that Kcnq1ot1 expression in the heart can be reactivated independently of Kcnq1ot1 expression. Thus, we find that tissue-specific loss of imprinting may be common during embryogenesis. We also show that Kcnq1ot1 can modulate the levels of another gene, Kdkn1c, which is crucial for heart development and function. We find that in later stages, Kcnq1ot1 has a role in repressing Kcnq1c. Our results reveal regulatory mechanisms that operate exclusively in the heart on Kcnq1, a gene crucial for heart development and function. We also uncover a novel mechanism by which an antisense RNA affects transcription through regulating chromatin flexibility and access to enhancers."

Here, we show that deletion of a specific enzyme in the pancreas causes insulin secretion to be impaired in mice, and that this impairment is due to the lack of 5-HT in the pancreas. These mice are diabetic and have reduced insulin secretion due to the lack of 5-HT in the pancreas. Further, we show that this dysfunction of insulin secretion is due to the inability of insulin to interact with its receptor. This finding is in line with the known receptor-mediated signaling pathway. Our results also show that 5-HT can regulate insulin secretion by modulating the activity of its receptor. This is the first report showing that 5-HT modulates insulin secretion by modulating insulin receptor function, and suggests that the activity of the receptor is required for the 5-HT to activate insulin secretion."

Here we report that the SLC25A38 protein and its yeast homolog Hem25 are mitochondrial glycine transporters required for the initiation of heme biosynthesis. We have shown that high levels of exogenous glycine, or 5-aminolevulinic acid ( 5-Ala ) a metabolite downstream of Hem25 in heme biosynthesis were able to restore heme levels to normal in yeast cells lacking Hem25 function. While neither glycine nor folate could ameliorate SLC25A38 congenital sideroblastic anemia in a zebrafish model, we determined that the addition of folate with glycine was able to restore hemoglobin levels. This difference is likely due to the fact that yeast can synthesize folate, whereas in zebrafish folate is an essential vitamin that must be obtained exogenously. Given the tolerability of glycine and folate in humans, this study points to a potential novel treatment for SLC25A38 congenital sideroblastic anemia."

Chromosomes in the pair that will become crossovers must associate and then separate together to allow their proper segregation at the first meiotic division. This is achieved by the formation of a physical link between homologous chromosomes called chiasmata, which allow them to be properly aligned on the chromosome axes. Crossovers are formed by the action of a group of proteins collectively known as ZMM. HFM1/Mer3 is in this group of proteins and is required for normal progression of homologous recombination and proper synapsis between homologous chromosomes in many organisms. Our work is the first study in mammals showing the in vivo function of mouse HFM1. We find that the initial steps of recombination are largely normal in a majority of Hfm1\u2212/\u2212 spermatocytes. In addition, we show that deletion of Hfm1 causes the elimination of a large fraction but not all COs. However, synapsis is altered with components of the central region of the synaptonemal complex frequently failing to extend the full length of the chromosome axes. We propose that initial steps of recombination are sufficient to support homology recognition, pairing, and initial chromosome synapsis and that HFM1 is required to form normal numbers of COs and to complete synapsis."

Examination of parasites recovered from the Cx. p. pipiens midgut by vital staining, and those exsheathed with papain, suggest that the damage inflicted by the midgut is subcuticular and disrupts internal tissues. Microscopic studies of these worms reveal compromised motility and sharp bends in the body; and ultrastructurally the presence of many fluid-filled vacuoles in the hypodermis, body wall, and nuclear column. We demonstrate that the Cx. p. pipiens midgut factor ( s ) that damage mf in vivo are soluble and stable in physiological buffer, and inflict damage on mf in vitro."

However, current statistical methods for detecting and testing associations between genetic variation and disease are limited to a small number of organisms. Here, we introduce a new method that is more powerful, robust, and can be used to study the genetic variation in many organisms. Our method is also easily accessible to researchers interested in testing genetic variants in a microbial community. We test our method on a bacterial community of Neisseria meningitidis, a common cause of meningitis and septicemia in humans. We show that our method is able to detect previously-identified associations in N. meningitidis and also identify new loci of interest. Our method is readily adaptable to other organisms and may be easily applied to other datasets."

The parasite replicates inside macrophages, and infection of macrophages with L. donovani results in the production of a protein ( arg1 ) that is toxic to macrophages and kills the parasites. This protein ( arg1 ) is produced by a complex pathway involving growth factor receptors and cytokines. Understanding how these pathways control arg1 production will help develop therapeutic strategies to prevent this fatal disease. In this work, we investigated the role of growth factor signaling in the production of arg1 in VL. We found that the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 ( FGFR-1 ) and Insulin-like Growth Factor ( IGF-1 ) and a number of downstream signaling proteins are activated in infected macrophages and that the expression of arg1 is dependent on STAT6 activation. Blocking these pathways reduced the ability of L. donovani to replicate in cells, and also the activation of STAT6. Our data indicate that these growth factor signaling pathways are important in the progression of L. donovani to the lethal form of VL."

Population-based coverage surveys are essential to understand the effectiveness of MDA programs, but published reports from trachoma programs are rare.

Although self-reported coverage was greater than 80% in some zones, programmatic improvements are warranted throughout Amhara to achieve higher coverage.

Here, we report the structure of the HCMV gB ectodomain, which is the first atomic-level structure of any betaherpesvirus glycoprotein. The structure of HCMV gB reveals that each gB has a unique domain arrangement, which may accommodate virus-specific functional requirements. Each gB has a unique domain arrangement, demonstrating structural plasticity of gB that may be necessary to shield neutralizing epitopes while exposing non-neutralizing epitopes. This glycosylation pattern may have evolved to direct the immune response towards generation of non-neutralizing antibodies. HCMV gB structure provides a starting point for elucidation of its antigenic and immunogenic properties and aid in the design of recombinant vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies."

In this study, we investigated the effect of interferon on HBV replication using a novel approach of using HBV transgenic mice. We found that interferon had opposite effects on HBV replication when viral load was high and low. Interferon also enhanced HBV replication by stimulating the transcription factor HNF3\u03b3 and activating STAT3, which together stimulated HBV gene expression and replication.

Recent studies have shown that the number of viral genomes that establish cell infection is surprisingly small ( 1\u201320 genomes ), which appears to be important for the adaptation and survival of viruses. To clarify how the number of viral genomes that establish cell infection is determined, we developed a simulation model of cell infection for tomato mosaic virus ( ToMV ), a positive-strand RNA virus. The model showed that the cell infection model predicted two interesting characteristics regarding cell infection: stochastic variation among cells in the number of viral genomes that establish infection and unequal proportion of progeny in each cell. Both characteristics were validated experimentally by inoculating tobacco cells with a library of nucleotide sequence\u2013tagged ToMV and analyzing the viral genomes that accumulated in each cell. An additional simulation model revealed that these two characteristics enhance selection during tissue infection. The cell infection model predicted a mechanism that enhances selection at the cellular level: a small difference in the replication abilities of coinfected variants results in a large difference in individual accumulation via the multiple-round formation of the replication complex ( i. e., the replication machinery ). Importantly, this predicted effect was observed in vivo. The cell infection model was robust to changes in the parameter values, suggesting that other viruses could adopt similar adaptation mechanisms."

Comparative genome hybridization was performed to query L. reuteri strains from different species of rodents, and we identified hundreds of genes that are specific to each strain. In order to differentiate true host-specific genome content from strain-level differences, comparative genome hybridizations were performed to query 57 L. reuteri strains from six different vertebrate hosts in combination with genome sequence comparisons of nine strains encompassing five phylogenetic lineages of the species. Our comparative genomic analyses revealed that rodent strains, although showing a high degree of genomic plasticity, possessed a specific genome inventory that was rare or absent in strains from other vertebrate hosts. The distinct genome content of L. reuteri lineages reflected the niche characteristics in the gastrointestinal tracts of their respective hosts, and inactivation of seven representative rodent-specific genes in L. reuteri 100-23 resulted in impaired ecological performance in the gut of mice. Our results provide new insights into the evolution of host specificity in a vertebrate gut symbiont, and also provide a molecular basis for the evolution of host specificity."

Further, we found that Akt-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in the mosquito midgut is coupled to the impairment of the epithelial barrier, which prevents the entry of parasites to the bloodstream. Blocking the action of the oxidative phosphorylation system, which is a critical part of mitochondrial function, by co-feeding of the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor L-name at infection abrogated Akt-dependent killing of P. falciparum.

To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms by which the virus evades the immune response. One of the mechanisms that the virus employs to evade the immune response is to prevent integration of the viral genome into the host DNA. In this study, we show that a molecular complex that is involved in the control of viral DNA integration is required to prevent the integration process from occurring in the stable state.

We show that the activation pathway is governed by two separate voltage-dependent steps followed by voltage-independent opening of the pore. According to this model analysis, the binding of cAMP to the channels exerts multiple effects on the voltage-dependent gating: it stabilizes the open pore, reduces the total gating charge from ~8 to ~5, makes an additional closed state outside the activation pathway accessible and strongly accelerates the ON-gating but not the OFF-gating. Furthermore, the open channel has a much slower computed OFF-gating current than the closed channel, in both the absence and presence of cAMP.

We propose that this interaction determines the extent of RSK1 phosphorylation in the nucleus to control transcription of immunosuppressive cytokines."

A similar senescence-like process was also detected in normal primary postmitotic megakaryocytes.

However, the exact mechanism ( s ) of the polymerization are not known.

RA is generally known to be important for establishing cell type and tissue differentiation in vertebrates. However, the role of RA in differential regulation of its target genes, which are necessary for establishing tissue differentiation and cell type specification, remains to be elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the role of RA in differential expression of the tandemly-duplicated long wavelength-sensitive ( LWS ) cone opsin genes in zebrafish embryos. We found that LWS1 is the upstream member of the tandemly duplicated LWS opsin array and is normally not expressed embryonically. Embryos treated with RA 48 hpf to 100 hpf or beyond showed significant reductions in LWS2-expressing cones in favor of LWS1 expression. The LWS reporter line, LWS-PAC ( H ), provided evidence that individual LWS cones switched from LWS2 to LWS1 expression in response to RA. The RA signaling reporter line, RARE:YFP, indicated that increased RA signaling in cones was associated with this opsin switch, and experimental reduction of RA signaling in larvae at the normal time of onset of LWS1 expression significantly inhibited LWS1 expression. A role for endogenous RA signaling in regulating differential expression of the LWS genes in postmitotic cones was further supported by the presence of an RA signaling domain in ventral retina of juvenile zebrafish that coincided with a ventral zone of LWS1 expression. This is the first evidence that an extracellular signal may regulate differential expression of opsin genes in a tandemly duplicated array."

A critical question in fungal pathogenesis is whether the fungal switch from yeast to hyphal growth influences host-pathogen interactions. Many fungi are dimorphic, and the switch from yeast to hyphal growth alters host-microbe interactions. We found that the calcineurin pathway, which controls hyphal growth, plays key roles in the dimorphic transition from yeast to hyphae. The gene encoding calcineurin is necessary for hyphal growth in the presence of the calcineurin inhibitor FK506, and disruption of the gene encoding the regulatory subunit of calcineurin leads to the formation of non-pathogenic yeast. We also found that calcineurin plays a critical role in the hyphal growth phase transition and virulence of the human pathogen Mucor circinelloides. We propose that the calcineurin pathway is necessary for hyphal growth, and that it regulates the growth phase transition and virulence of this important fungal pathogen."

An important component of the mosquito gut is the hemolymph, which contains a variety of hemocytes, including erythrocytes. Anopheline mosquitoes are naturally resistant to the blood of humans and therefore develop Plasmodium in the hemolymph. An improved understanding of the mechanism by which the hemolymph interferes with parasite development will have important implications for the development of new types of malaria control strategies. Here, we describe the generation of transgenic Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes that express the C-type lectin CEL-III from the sea cucumber, Cucumaria echinata, in a midgut-specific manner. CEL-III exhibits strong and rapid hemolytic activity toward human and rat erythrocytes. Moreover, it exhibits strong cytotoxicity toward ookinetes, leading to impaired parasite development in vitro.

Building upon previous studies that have characterized a large family of An. gambiae odorant receptors ( AgORs ), we now use behavioral analyses and gene silencing to examine directly the role of AgORs, as well as a newly identified family of candidate chemosensory genes, in the larval olfactory system. Our results reveal that there are at least two distinct olfactory pathways in An. gambiae. One pathway depends directly on AgORs and requires the expression and activity of AgIRs. In contrast, the other pathway is AgOR-independent and requires the expression and activity of AgIRs.

We recently reported that the protein phosphatase Fgf23 is responsible for the low serum vitamin D levels in XLH mice. However, the role of Fgf23 in osteomalacia, a critical tissue for bone mineralization, has not been explored. Here, we report that increased levels of Fgf23 are detected in Hyp osteocytes, but not in osteoblasts, and that Tmsp is down-regulated in Hyp-derived osteocyte-like cells. In addition, we show that blocking of increased Fgf23-FGFR3 signaling with anti-Fgf23 antibodies or an FGFR3 inhibitor partially restored the suppressed TNAP activity, phosphate production, and mineralization, and decreased pyrophosphate concentration in Hyp-derived osteocyte-like cells in vitro. Furthermore, treatment of wild-type osteoblasts or mice with recombinant FGF23 suppressed TCTS expression and increased pyrophosphate concentrations in the culture medium and in bone, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that the cell autonomous increase in Fgf23 secretion in Hyp osteocytes drives the accumulation of pyrophosphate through auto-/paracrine suppression of TNAP.

The highest interspecific association of up to 0. 596 was observed between An. maculipennis s. l/An. pseudopictus followed by up to 0. 27 between An. maculipennis s. l/An. hyrcanus and An. hyrcanus/An. pseudopictus. The correlations observed between physicochemical factors and larval density, can possibly confirm the effect of these parameters on the breeding activities of mosquitoes, and may be indicative of the presence of some mosquito fauna in a given region."

In 2001, BSE was characterized by a unique type of the disease-associated prion protein ( PrPSc ), which was found in cattle from several countries. BSE is the most frequently found prion disease in cattle worldwide and BSE is the most frequently detected prion disease in humans. BSE is characterized by the presence of a variety of different prion proteins in the brain and in the heart, as well as the presence of a prion protein ( PrP ) that is normally associated with prion disease. BSE is characterized by a distinct type of the disease-associated prion protein ( PrPSc ), which is not found in the classical BSE prion protein ( PrP ). Here, we show that the agents responsible for BSE and BASE have different biological properties upon transmission to transgenic mice. Strikingly, when the BASE strain was transmitted to nontransgenic mice, it induced a neuropathological and molecular disease phenotype indistinguishable from that of BSE-infected mice. The existence of more than one agent associated with prion disease in cattle and the ability of the BASE strain to convert into the BSE strain may have important implications with respect to the origin of BSE and spongiform encephalopathies in other species, including humans."

FAK suppressed signalling in Drosophila epithelia by impairing MAPK pathway. This regulation was also observed in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, suggesting it is a conserved phenomenon in humans. Mechanistically, FAK reduced receptor recycling into the plasma membrane, which resulted in lower MAPK activation. Conversely, increasing the membrane pool of the receptor increased MAPK pathway signalling. Therefore, FAK-mediated negative regulation of RTK/MAPK signalling may have potential implications in cancer biology, but also in tumour suppressor properties in some contexts."

In vitro and intracellular amastigotes are amably sensitive to inhibition of mitochondrial aconitase and glutamine synthetase, indicating that these anabolic pathways are essential for intracellular growth and virulence. Lesion-derived amastigotes exhibit a similar metabolism to in vitro differentiated amastigotes, indicating that this stringent response is coupled to differentiation signals rather than exogenous nutrient levels.

Here, we develop a computational model of a metastatic tumor capturing key features of known tumor-immune interactions that faithfully recapitulates key features of existing experimental observations. Surprisingly, over a wide range of model formulations, we observed that heterogeneity in both spatial organization and cell phenotype drove the emergence of immunosuppressive network states. We then used this model as an in silico test bed to evaluate potential strategies for engineering cell-based therapies to overcome tumor associated immune dysfunction and thereby identify modes of immune modulation predicted to be most effective.

Curiously, a block in IMC biogenesis does not affect the formation of sub-pellicular microtubules, indicating that IMC biogenesis is not mechanistically linked.

The T4CP of L. pneumophila T4SS, called DotL, was recently defined based on its homology to known T4CPs, which function as inner-membrane receptors for substrates. As a result, DotL is hypothesized to play an integral role ( s ) in the L. pneumophila T4SS for the engagement and translocation of substrates. To elucidate this role, a genetic approach was taken to screen for dotL mutants that were unable to survive inside host cells. One mutant, dotLY726 STOP, did not interact with type IV adaptor proteins IcmS/IcmW ( IcmSW ) leading to the identification of an IcmSW-binding domain on DotL. Interestingly, the dotLY725stop mutant was competent for export of one class of secreted effectors, but exhibited a specific defect in secretion of IcmSW-dependent substrates. This differential secretion illustrates that DotL requires a direct interaction with the type IV adaptor proteins for the secretion of a major class of substrates. Thus, by identifying a new target for IcmSW, we have discovered that the type IV adaptors perform an additional role in the export of substrates by the L. pneumophila Dot/Icm T4SS."

We find that stimulus-induced changes in population activity can be explained by a spatially broad stimulus, and show that a model of a network of first two stages of the electrosensory system predicts this phenomenon.

ATR has been shown to be involved in the protection against DNA replication inhibitors and DNA replication stress, but it is unclear whether ATR is also involved in the control of apoptosis following DNA replication stress. Recent evidence indicates that the downstream effector Chk1, which is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, also plays a role in the control of apoptosis following DNA replication stress. We have manipulated the effects of depletion of ATM or its downstream effector Chk1, and have demonstrated that depletion of both Chk1 and ATM has relatively little effect on apoptosis induced by DNA replication inhibitors. Furthermore, we show that the ATR- and Chk1-dependent pathways are distinct from those responding to IR. Our results show that ATR and Chk1 are involved in the control of apoptosis following DNA replication stress and that the Chk1-suppressed pathway protects cells from replication stress."

Current drugs are effective only for a limited number of patients and are associated with the development of resistance. There is an urgent need to develop new drugs against amebiasis. Infection of the host with the parasite has been shown to block the production of cysts, which are structures that are found in the host intestine and the blood vessels. In this study, we show that exposure to different stresses from the host immune system, as well as intestinal bacterial infections, can induce encystment of cysts. Our results suggest that the parasite may be able to survive exposure to these stresses by forming spherical structures. These results may help to develop new drugs against amebiasis."

Infection begins with the ingestion of F. tularensis eggs in macrophages. In macrophages, F. tularensis is able to survive and multiply within macrophages by regulating expression of genes involved in innate immunity. The expression of these genes is tightly regulated, and each of these genes is expressed only when the appropriate signal is received. To do this, F. tularensis uses a set of three transcription factors called MglA, SspA, and PigR. MglA and SspA associate with RNA polymerase, whereas PigR is a putative DNA-binding protein. We found that both MglA and SspA and PigR are present at virtually all promoters in F. tularensis and not only those of regulated genes. Furthermore, we found that the ability of PigR to associate with promoters is dependent upon the presence of MglA, suggesting that interaction with the RNAP-associated MglA-SspA complex at the majority of promoters in F. tularensis is necessary for PigR to associate with those promoters. Our findings reveal how transcription factors can exert regulatory effects at a restricted set of promoters despite being associated with most or all."

The long-lived virus has a slow replication rate and a slow decay rate, and therefore, it can take many years to elapse before viral rebound. A better understanding of the mechanisms of HIV-1 persistence will be of great importance for developing new antiviral therapies. Here, we present a mathematical model of HIV-1 infection that predicts the kinetics of viral replication under treatment with and without a specific class of antiretroviral drugs. We show that HIV-1 infection is mostly sustained by short-lived infected cells with fast integration and a short viral production period, and by long-lived infected cells with slow integration but an equally short viral production period. We also show that the efficacy of RAL-containing drugs can be estimated by the difference in viral load at the start of the second phase in protocols with and without RAL. Our results provide a mechanistic model of viral infection that parsimoniously explains the kinetics of viral load decline under multiple classes of antiretrovirals."

We find that the assembly of large transcription factor complexes on chromatin via equilibrium-binding mechanisms is highly inefficient and insensitive to concentration changes of individual regulatory proteins.

To address this concern, we developed a new tool that can be used to maximize the impact of dog management resources. Our tool is accessible through a web-based interface that allows for flexibility in the management strategies that can be investigated. In many areas, the costs of contacting additional dogs increases as management effort increases, and this can have important strategic implications. We applied the tool to several alternative management strategies in an area of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa.

In parallel, using mouse and human metastasis gene expression data it was observed that extracellular matrix ( ECM ) genes are common components of metastasis predictive signatures, suggesting that ECM genes are either important markers or causal factors in metastasis. Using ECM gene expression, Rrp1b expression was found to be consistently associated with tumor progression in a human breast cancer cohort. To investigate the relationship between ECM genes and poor prognosis in breast cancer, expression quantitative trait locus analysis of polyoma middle-T transgene-induced mammary tumor was performed. ECM gene expression was found to be consistently associated with Rrp1b expression. In vitro expression of Rrp1b significantly altered ECM gene expression, tumor growth, and dissemination in metastasis assays. Furthermore, a gene signature induced by ectopic expression of Rrp1b in tumor cells predicted survival in a human breast cancer gene expression dataset. Finally, constitutional polymorphism within RRP1B was found to be significantly associated with tumor progression in two independent breast cancer cohorts. These data suggest that RRP1B may be a novel susceptibility gene for breast cancer progression and metastasis."

Here, we show that the hybridization mechanisms of the two species that have recently separated and purified a common host plant, Arabidopsis, are not identical. In fact, the hybrids recognize the same host cell but only one of the parental species does so. We also show that the hybrids' DNA sequences can be used to predict their reproductive barriers, suggesting that the hybridization mechanisms of the two species are not independent. This suggests that the hybridization mechanisms used by the two species to recognize a common host cell may be more similar, and that the hybridization mechanisms used by the two species to recognize a common host cell may be more similar.

While placental malaria is a well-known and severe manifestation, it is not well understood how the parasite escapes the placenta.

CSPG is known to bind to the placental chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan ( CSPG ), but its identity and role in the placenta remain to be defined. We show that CSPG is present on placental plasmids, and that it is present on the surface of cells from the placenta. Further characterization of CSPG interactions with its receptors, as well as the effects on cell function, show that the interaction is important for the parasite to survive in the placenta.

We use the rich collection of F-scores ( the miRNA-gene and gene-miRNA relations ) in the PubMed abstracts to extract the miRNA-gene and miRNA-gene relationships. We show that the results of miRTex are well-defined and consistent, as well as the results of the full-scale text mining process. We demonstrate the usefulness of miRTex by identifying genes potentially regulated by miRNAs in Triple Negative Breast Cancer, as well as miRNA-gene relations that, in conjunction with kinase-substrate relations, regulate the response to abiotic stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.

MicroRNAs and piRNAs, the most abundant class of sRNAs, play an important role in development of multicellular organisms. Methylation of the 3\u2032 ends of piRNAs and sRNAs by the methyltransferase HEN1 has been shown to be essential for the stability of these sRNAs. Here we show that HEN1 is also required in Nematostella vectensis, a sea anemone. We find that the levels of both miRNAs and piRNAs decrease dramatically in N. vectensis, and that HEN1 is required for the stabilization of its sRNAs. Moreover, knockdown of HEN1 in N. vectensis results in developmental arrest. Our results suggest that HEN1-mediated methylation of sRNAs reflects the ancestral state, where miRNAs were also methylated. Thus, we provide the first evidence of a methylation mechanism that stabilizes miRNAs in animals, and highlight the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in non-bilaterian animals."

To establish infection, IAV must penetrate the host cell, a complex process that requires the action of a large number of cellular proteins. Here, we have investigated the role of a specific class of proteins, histone deacetylases ( HDACs ), in promoting IAV entry. We found that depletion of HDAC8 caused a dramatic alteration in the structure and dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is essential for the functioning of the IAV particle. This alteration resulted in a loss of directed migration of the IAV particles towards the periphery of the cell. Depleting HDAC8 also caused a dramatic reduction in the number of centrosomes, which are critical organelles for IAV particle assembly. Influenza A virus also requires centrosome function during infection, and the disruption of centrosome cohesion was found to be critical for IAV entry. These results establish the importance of HDACs in IAV entry and demonstrate that a novel function of HDACs, which is not known, is to promote IAV entry."

Pulsatile dynamics are thought to be widespread, and single-cell live imaging of gene expression has led to a surge of dynamic, possibly oscillatory, data for different gene networks. However, the regulation of gene expression at the level of an individual cell involves reactions between finite numbers of molecules, and this can result in inherent randomness in expression dynamics, which blurs the boundaries between aperiodic fluctuations and noisy oscillators. Here, we develop a new method that combines a stochastic mathematical model with a powerful statistical method for non-parametric regression with Gaussian processes. Our method can distinguish oscillatory gene expression from random fluctuations of non-oscillatory expression in single-cell time series, despite peak-to-peak variability in period and amplitude of single-cell oscillations. Analysis of bioluminescence data shows a significantly greater number of oscillatory cells when luciferase is driven by a Hes1 promoter ( 10/19 ), which has previously been reported to oscillate, than the constitutive MoMuLV 5\u2019 LTR ( MMLV ) promoter ( 0/25 ).

All ZIKVLP vaccinated mice survived with no morbidity or weight loss while control animals either died at 9 days post challenge ( AG129 ) or increased viremia ( BALB/c ). Neutralizing antibodies were observed in all ZIKVLP vaccinated mice. Our findings demonstrate the protective efficacy of ZIKVLP and highlight the important role that neutralizing antibodies play in protection against ZIKV infection."

The frequency and impact of CNVs on a variety of neurological phenotypes has been difficult to ascertain due to small sample sizes, lack of phenotypic details, and heterogeneity in platforms used for discovery. Here we describe a method that enables the identification of CNVs on a wide range of neurological phenotypes, including dyslexia ( a disorder of the brain ), autism, and intellectual disability ( a disorder of the brain ). We show that the frequency of large CNVs ( >1 Mbp ) is significantly greater for ID\u2013associated phenotypes compared to autism ( p\u200a=\u200a2. 75\u00d710\u221211, odds ratio\u200a=\u200a4. 59 ), dyslexia ( p\u200a=\u200a3. 81\u00d710\u221218, odds ratio\u200a=\u200a10. 45 ) or controls ( p\u200a=\u200a2. 75\u00d710\u221217, odds ratio\u200a=\u200a10. 13, 000, odds ratio\u200a=\u200a10. 5 ).

However, the mechanism of this sensitivity has been difficult to study because of the inherent instability of the synapses. We show that a small temporal shift in the window of the synaptic plasticity window that causes synchronous, or nearly synchronous, pre- and postsynaptic action potentials to induce long-term depression can stabilize synaptic strengths. The general level of inhibition regulates whether plasticity is Hebbian or anti-Hebbian. Our results indicate that the shape of the STDP window is of the utmost importance in determining the consequences of STDP, suggesting that this region warrants further experimental study."

The recent availability of transcriptome and genome sequence information has stimulated the development of RNAi. This is a method that uses double-stranded ( ds ) RNA as a means to target genes of interest. While RNAi has been successfully used in studies of single gene function, the extent of off-targeting effects is limited. Here, we investigated in vitro the sensitivity and selectivity of RNAi using dsRNA designed to target 11 S. mansoni genes that are expressed in different tissues. We employed mechanical transformation of schistosomula that are relevant to human parasitism. Results showed that RNAi was best achieved by co-incubating parasites and dsRNA. We also investigated the efficacy of RNAi and the role of the parasite in relation to the infective stage, the larval stage, the snail intermediate host and the human host. We found that RNAi was selective to the gene target ( s ) within the pools of transcripts representative of each tissue. Additionally, we identified the RNAi intermediates.

This balance has been shown in vivo to be important for cortical function. However, it remains unclear what mechanism underlies the fine tuning required for the balance of feed forward excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Here, we address this issue by analyzing a computational model of cortical plasticity that accounts for both feed forward excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Our analysis shows that the inhibitory inputs can be naturally balanced by a simple Hebbian plasticity mechanism that can account for both feed forward excitatory and inhibitory inputs. As a result, the balance may increase the sensitivity of the learning dynamics to the correlation structure of the excitatory inputs."

In this work, we analyzed the DNA sequences of a set of transcription factor classes and compared them to identify DNA sequence motifs. We used a novel algorithm which was developed to analyze these motifs. We found that the approach was superior to other approaches and that the approach was able to predict the sequence motifs. We then applied the algorithm to two different transcription factor classes and found that the two classes were defined by their DNA sequences.

Our model is based on the theory of a stochastic neural network, and thus is able to reproduce the ability of the neural network to extract informative pitch from spiking neural activity. The ability of the neural network to extract informative pitch is described by a correlation-based neural network model that is unsupervised to consider synchronous or correlated neural activity.

While the mechanisms of CMV reactivation are well understood, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge of CMV-associated diseases. Here, we report the results of a dual analysis of CMV and host cell transcriptomes during lytic infection using both classical cDNA cloning and next generation sequencing of viral transcripts and host transcriptomes.

We identify numerous novel spliced and unspliced transcripts of MCMV. Unexpectedly, the most abundant viral transcript is of unknown function. We also report that lytic infection elicits a profound cellular response in fibroblasts. Highly upregulated and induced host genes included those involved in inflammation and immunity, but also many unexpected transcription factors and host genes related to development and differentiation. Correspondingly, many differentially expressed genes cluster in biological pathways that may shed new light on cytomegalovirus pathogenesis.

We found that the beneficial effects on learning are independent of changes in overall organism physiology and, instead, are due to changes in a specific molecular metabolite\u2014kynurenic acid ( KyN ) \u2014which is depleted upon DR. KyN depletion then leads to activation of a specific pair of neurons that mediate learning. This activation of a specific pair of neurons depends on the specific metabolic state of the organism, which we believe, contributes to the beneficial effects of DR on learning. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of DR on learning can be attributed to changes in a nutritionally sensitive metabolite, which does not alter lifespan, rather than changes in lifespan or physiology. Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of DR on learning can be attributed to changes in a specific metabolite with neuromodulatory activity rather than direct or secondary consequences of improved health and extended lifespan."

Many of the DNA replication problems that arise during replication are thought to result from transcription perturbations, which are induced by environmental stimuli, such as DNA damage, or from replication errors. DNA damage can be detected by several components of the replicative apparatus, including the MCM helicase, which is the key component responsible for replicating DNA. Here, we have found that a specific mcm allele ( mcm2PTR ) causes elevated levels of genome instability that correlate with the appearance of numerous DNA-damage associated foci of \u03b3H2AX and Rad52. Our data also show that the triggering events for this genome instability are elevated levels of RNA:DNA hybrids, and that this DNA damage is dependent upon progression into metaphase. In addition, we show that the DNA damage is not due to spontaneous S-phase fork collapse. In total, these unusual mcm2PTR phenotypes are markedly similar to those of a special previously-studied allele of the checkpoint kinase ATR/MEC1, suggesting a possible regulatory interplay between Mcm2-7 and ATR during unchallenged growth."

Despite the availability of live-attenuated YF vaccine strains, 17D-204 and 17DD, the ability of YFV to evade and/or disable components of the immune response, and the role of these elements of the immune response, have not been well characterized. Here, we describe the development of a small animal model for wild-type YFV infection that manifested clinical disease representative of that seen in primates without adaptation of the virus to the host, which was required for the current hamster YF model. Investigation of the role of type I interferon ( IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 ) in protection of mice from viscerotropic YFV infection revealed that mice lacking IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptors or STAT1 signaling molecules were highly susceptible to infection and disease, succumbed within 6\u20137 days, and rapidly cleared the virus from the liver, spleen and liver, suggestive of a cytokine storm. In striking contrast, infection of A129 and STAT129 mice with the 17D-204 vaccine virus was subclinical, like immunization in humans, and rapidly cleared the virus from the liver, without infectivity for the macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro. These data demonstrate that the ability of YFV to evade and/or disable components of the immune response may be primate-specific such that infection of mice with a functional IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response is attenuated. Consequently, subcutaneous YFV infection of A129 mice represents a biologically relevant model for studying viscerotropic infection and disease development following wild-type YFV infection, as well as mechanisms of 17D-204 vaccine attenuation, without a requirement for adaptation of the virus."

We studied the activation of immune cells, neutrophils, in P. vivax-infected patients at different times after the first dose of treatment. We also examined the effect of activation markers and cytokines produced by neutrophils and monocytes, the two main types of immune cells. Our results indicate that neutrophils are activated during the acute phase of the infection. We also examined the effects of activation markers and cytokines produced by neutrophils in response to P. vivax infection. We found that neutrophils were highly activated and produced high levels of cytokines, whereas monocytes were found to be the source of these cytokines. We also found that neutrophils from malaria patients were impaired in their ability to sense pathogens and were less able to respond to secondary bacterial infection. Our study provides new insights into the effects of activation markers and cytokines produced by neutrophils, and suggests that these are a poor source of pro-inflammatory cytokines and are more susceptible to secondary bacterial infection."

In normal physiological function, endothelial growth factor ( EGF ) can stimulate vascular remodeling by activating receptor tyrosine kinases, increasing intracellular calcium levels. However, while the signaling initiated by EGF binding to receptor tyrosine kinases is largely mediated by the action of soluble EGF, it is poorly understood how receptor tyrosine kinases respond to EGF binding. In this paper, we develop a computational model to study the binding of soluble and immobilized EGF to VEGF receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ), the endosomal trafficking of VEGFR2, and site-specific VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation. We show that site-specific differences in VEGFR2 activation are largely consistent across multiple endothelial cell lines. Our simulations also show that soluble VEGF can only account for changes in surface-to-internal VEGFR2 concentrations. Our computer model is the first to show that differences in site-specific VEGFR2 activation can be accounted for by altered trafficking of VEGFR2 without an intrinsic difference in receptor activation. We also identify key levers that affect VEGFR2 trafficking and downstream signaling."

It is known that these aggregates can be toxic and cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. We have used computer simulations to show how the process of assembly can be divided into two steps. The first is characterised by a hydrophobic coalescence resulting in the formation of molten oligomers in which hydrophobic residues are sequestered away from the solvent. In the second step, the oligomers undergo a process of reorganisation driven by interchain hydrogen bonding interactions that induce the formation of \u03b2 sheet rich assemblies. We show that the process of aggregation into either order or amorphous species is largely determined by a competition between the hydrophobicity of the amino acid sequence and the tendency of polypeptide chains to form arrays of hydrogen bonds. We discuss how the increase in solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface resulting from such a competition offers an explanation for recent observations concerning the cytotoxicity of oligomeric species formed prior to mature amyloid fibrils."

In the 32 cases where samples of sufficient quality for analysis were available, rabies was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ). Post-exposure prophylaxis with rabies vaccine was administered to all animal exposure victims presenting at the NCTS local units, although only about 57% completed the full immunization schedule. All available reports were provided by the NPTH, local health centers, and increased veterinarian engagement. These represent substantial advances, but further improvements to the surveillance system are needed to increase disease awareness and capture cases that are currently missed by the system."

Nitrogen-fixing symbioses are defined by the presence of rhizobia bacteria in plant cells, and by the phylogenetic restriction of the interaction of the symbiosis with the host plant. In contrast, the phylogenetic restriction of the interaction between the symbiosis and the host plant indicates a common and recent evolutionary innovation. Here, we show that a plant receptor-kinase, SYMRK, is required for actinorhizobia ( AM ) -symbiosis with the host plant Arabidopsis, and for the Arbuscular Mycorrhizia ( AM ) symbiosis with phosphate-acquiring fungi, which is widespread in occurrence and believed to date back to the earliest land plants. We also provide evidence that the shorter forms of rice and tomato are sufficient for AM, but not for functional endosymbiosis with bacteria in the legume Lotus japonicus. Our data support the idea that SYMRK sequence evolution was involved in the recruitment of a pre-existing signalling network from AM, paving the way for the evolution of intracellular root symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."

Following infection, WNV particles assemble in the cells of the infected individual and are released into the blood stream to cause the viral replication and disease. Under conditions of oxidative stress, WNV particles can also form stress granules in the cell, which block viral RNA translation and block viral RNA synthesis. Here we show that WNV infection triggers the induction of oxidative stress, which activates the cellular kinase HRI, resulting in the formation of stress granules. As a result, WNV infection causes the accumulation of glutathione in the cell and increases the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ). ROS then inhibit the synthesis of viral RNA and prevent mitochondrial damage. We also show that the activation of antioxidant genes in the infected cells is required for the inhibition of ROS-induced damage. Our results suggest that WNV infection induces changes in the redox state of the cell and a mitochondrial antioxidant response that protects the infected cell from ROS-induced damage. This response is sufficient to prevent the infection of cells by WNV and other viruses."

Genetic studies of osmoregulation in yeast have identified mucin-like proteins as critical regulators of osmosensitive signaling and gene expression. Here, we show that mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans mucin-like gene osm-8 specifically disrupt osmoregulatory physiological processes. We used a genome-wide RNAi screen and identified 27 suppressor, 18, 000 gene, to identify genes required for osm-8 phenotypes. We found that one suppressor, the transmembrane protein PTR-23, is co-expressed with osm-8 in the hypodermis and strongly suppresses several Osm-8 phenotypes, including the transcriptional activation of many osmosensitive mRNAs, constitutive glycerol accumulation, and osmotic stress resistance. Our studies are the first to show that an extracellular mucin-like protein plays an important role in animal osmoregulation in a manner that requires the activity of a novel transmembrane protein. Given that mucins and transmembrane proteins play similar roles in yeast osmoregulation, our findings suggest a possible evolutionarily conserved role for the mucin-plasma membrane interface in eukaryotic osmoregulation."

In contrast, resistance to the third major antifungal used in the clinic, amphotericin B ( AmB ), remains extremely rare despite 50 years of use as monotherapy. We sought to understand this long-standing evolutionary puzzle. We identified and investigated mutations that confer AmB resistance in vitro. Resistance to AmB came at a great cost. We found that mutations conferred resistance simultaneously created diverse stresses that required high levels of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 for survival. This requirement stems from the mutations, which drastically diminished tolerance to external stresses from the host. AmB-resistant mutants were hypersensitive to oxidative stress, febrile temperatures, and killing by neutrophils and also had defects in filamentation and tissue invasion. Our work provides a vivid example of the ways in which conflicting selective pressures shape evolutionary trajectories. Developing antibiotics that deliberately create such evolutionary constraints may offer a strategy for limiting the rapid emergence of drug resistance."

The outcome of infection is determined by the interaction of the bacteria with macrophages; however, we lack a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in intracellular infection.

We demonstrate that metabolic networks with the same phenotype form large sets that can be traversed through single mutations, and that different mutations of the same type can yield very different phenotypes.

We have found that >95% of CPV isolates were derived from CPV-like viruses, suggesting that CPV is dominant in sylvatic cycles. To examine the process of host adaptation, we passaged several viruses in cells from different carnivore species. We found that mutations were selected for in each background, regardless of the particular background of the virus and the host cells in which they were passaged. Interestingly, mutations in the viral proteins of the different carnivore species often found near sites of virus\u2013receptor interactions, and in particular, these mutations occurred in and around the apical domain where the virus binds. Some of the viruses also accumulated high levels of variation upon passage in alternative hosts, while others could infect multiple different hosts with no or only a few additional mutations. Overall, these studies demonstrate that the evolutionary history of a virus, including how long it has been circulating and in which hosts, as well as its phylogenetic background, has a profound effect on determining viral host range."

We find that the asymmetry observed in 3D images arises from different optimality principles, one of which optimality in the human head and torso is optimized by the same principles as those in the mouse lung. The difference between human head and torso is only found when the ratio of arterial pressure to body mass is greater than 50, 000, which is the same as the ratio of metabolic rate to body mass in the mouse lung.

The mechanisms responsible for the recognition and clearance of misfolded RhP23H and their relevance to photoreceptor neuron ( PN ) degeneration are poorly understood. Here, we show that RhP23H is a substrate of the ER\u2013associated degradation ( ERAD ) effector VCP/ter94, a chaperone that removes misfolded proteins from the ER ( a process called retrotranslocation ) and facilitates their proteasomal degradation. Despite this, Rh1P37H ( the equivalent of mammalian RhP23H ) is expressed in PNs and is required for Rh1P37H toxicity. Genetic inactivation of VCP increased the levels of misfolded Rh1P37H and further activated the Ire1/Xbp1 ER stress pathway in the Rh1P37H retina. Despite this, Rh1P37H flies with decreased VCP function demonstrated a potent suppression of retinal degeneration and blindness, indicating that VCP activity promotes neurodegeneration in the Rh1P37H retina. Pharmacological treatment of Rh1P37H flies with the VCP/ERAD inhibitor Eeyarestatin I or with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 also led to a strong suppression of retinal degeneration.

These two responses are mediated by the expression of the Polo kinases ( Plks ), which are part of the signal transduction pathway.

Lung cancer is the most common and aggressive type of lung cancer, accounting for 27, 540 deaths per year. Despite a high incidence of lung cancer and a high incidence of invasive disease, very little is known about the factors that promote the growth and progression of lung cancer. Here, we show that the transcription factor FoxM1 is highly expressed in lung cancer and that this factor accelerates the growth of lung cancer cells. We also demonstrate that increased expression of FoxM1 in mouse lung cancer cells induces growth and invasion of the lung. We also show that the human homologue of FoxM1, AGR2, is necessary and sufficient to induce lung cancer growth and tumor invasion in vivo. Thus, FoxM1 is necessary and sufficient to induce lung cancer growth and progression in vivo."

Here, we report the molecular mechanism for assembly of the Vif-EloBC ternary complex. We demonstrate that Vif binds toelonginBC ( elongin ) in two locations, and that both interactions induce structural changes in the SOCS box of Vif as well as elongin. Using cell-based assays, we further show that this interaction is necessary for the formation of a functional ligase complex, thus establishing a role of this motif. We conclude that HIV-1 Vif engages Glass via an induced-folding mechanism that does not require additional co-factors, and speculate that these features may enhance the prospects of obtaining therapeutic inhibitors of Vif function."

Cryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii, a species that causes fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, has a bipolar mating system, and a single biallelic locus governs sexual reproduction. MAT is a large, highly transcribed locus that contains >20 genes, and it has been proposed to have originated a tetrapolar system from a common ancestor. Here, we show that a fosmid library was used to isolate MAT from C. heveanensis, a sister species to the pathogenic species complex. Positive fosmids were sequenced, and assembled to generate two large unlinked MAT gene clusters. Strikingly, two divergent homeodomain genes are present, similar to the bE/bW Ustilago maydis paradigm, suggesting one or the other homeodomain gene was recently lost in C. neoformans/C. gattii. MAT genes from other C. heveanensis isolates revealed a multiallelic homeodomain locus and at least a biallelic pheromone/receptor locus, similar to known tetrapolar species. These studies reveal an extant C. heveanensis sexual cycle, define the structure of its MAT locus consistent with tetrapolar mating, and support the proposed evolutionary model for the bipolar Cryptococcus MAT locus."

We analyzed the role of ZLL and AGO1 in the control of small RNA-directed gene silencing. We found that ZLL and AGO1 function redundantly and specifically in the control of a subset of AGO1 target genes. ZLL, however, is not subjected to small RNA-mediated repression itself, and this cross regulation has the potential to adjust RNA silencing activity independent of feedback dynamics. We also show that ZLL, but not AGO1, can rescue only a few AGO1 functions when expressed from the AGO1 promoter, suggesting that the specific functions of AGO1 and ZLL are mainly determined by their protein sequence. We also show that the PAZ domain, which is involved in 5\u2032-end small RNA selectivity and mRNA cleavage, is interchangeable between the two proteins, suggesting that this common small RNA-binding domain contributes to redundant functions. By contrast, the conserved MID and PIWI domains, which are involved in 5\u2032-end small RNA selectivity and mRNA cleavage, and the non-conserved N-terminal domain, to which no function has been assigned, provide specificity to AGO1 and ZLL protein function."

The method is applied to the conformational changes induced by ATP binding to the nucleotide-binding domain ( NBD ) of Hsp70. Unbiased MD simulations were performed for Hsp70-DnaK chaperone in nucleotide-free, ADP-bound and ATP-bound states. The analysis of the free-energy landscape revealed that the nucleotide-induced conformational changes in ATP binding are intermediate states between the initial nucleotide-free and final ATP-bound states of Hsp70.

HP1 is detected on pericentric regions, and is marked by the histone variant H3. 3 and dimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me2 ). HP1 exhibits a striking preference for exon-dense genes on chromosome arms. Furthermore, HP1 binds along entire transcription units, except for 5\u2032 regions. Comparison with expression data shows that most of these genes are actively transcribed. HP1 target genes are also marked by the histone variant H3. 3 and dimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me2 ), which are both typical of active chromatin. Interestingly, H3. 3 deposition, which is usually observed along entire transcription units, is limited to the 5\u2032 ends of HP1-bound genes. Thus, H3. 3 and HP1 are mutually exclusive marks on active chromatin. Additionally, we observed that HP1-chromatin and Polycomb-chromatin are nonoverlapping, but often closely juxtaposed, suggesting an interplay between both types of chromatin. These results demonstrate that HP1-chromatin is transcriptionally active and has extensive links with several other chromatin components."

Telomere capping proteins, such as Cdc13 and POT1, are essential for the viability of budding yeast and mammalian cells, respectively. In this study, we identify three genetic modifications that allow budding yeast cells to survive without telomere capping by Cdc13. We show that the RecQ helicase Sgs1 plays an important role in the resection of uncapped telomeres, especially in the absence of checkpoint protein Rad9. Deletion of SGS1 and the nuclease EXO1, further reduces resection at uncapped telomeres and together with deletion of RAD9 permits cell survival without CDC13. However, with continued passage, the telomeres of such strains eventually become short and are maintained by recombination-based mechanisms. Remarkably, cdc13\u0394 rad9\u0394 exo1\u0394 strains, lacking any Cdc13 gene product, are viable and can grow indefinitely.

Here we report the use of next generation sequencing to study the effect of PZQ on the expression of mouse liver genes in response to Schistosoma mansoni worms and eggs. We found that the response of the liver was still able to respond to the drug at the time egg laying begins, but there was a significant reduction in egg burden yet the liver responses were still able to respond to PZQ. We also used a technique to quantify the expression of 16 genes in juvenile parasites and in adult worms. We found that only some of the genes could be expressed in the liver when PZQ was administered at this time. However, the juvenile worms were able to activate the expression of other genes in the liver. Our results suggest that the liver was able to respond to PZQ in part through a process that involves the activation of ABCB, C and G family members.

There is currently no consensus on the best way to model the transmission of this disease, and no consensus on what is needed to improve the current model. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of existing T. solium transmission models and an assessment of how these models compare with each other and with other widely used models of T. solium.

We have demonstrated that low levels of NS1-BP can specifically inhibit the splicing of the viral M1 segment to yield the M2 segment, but that this NS1-BP protein complex is functional in mediating the splicing of the M1 segment. NS1-BP and hnRNP K proteins bind M1 mRNA and block its splicing, inhibiting viral replication.

Here, we demonstrate that the cytokine IL-10 is the most important anti-inflammatory factor produced by the innate immune system and that it limits the spread of VV in the skin. In vivo analyses revealed that IL-10-producing cells were distributed throughout areas of the inflamed skin lacking overt virus-infection, but closely associated with large keratinocytic foci of virus replication where they exhibited similar motility patterns to bulk antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Paradoxically, neutralizing IL-10 in vivo with an anti-IL-10 antibody increased viral lesion size and viral replication. Additional analyses demonstrated that IL-10 antibody decreased recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes, which were important for reducing viral burden in the infected skin.

Although the molecular mechanisms of sex determination are well studied, there are still gaps in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of sex determination. To address this gap, we profiled the transcriptomes of the XX and XY gonads in the mouse during the period of sexual development. We discovered that the C57BL/6J ( B6 ) XY gonads showed a consistent \u223c5-hour delay in activation of most male pathway genes and repression of female pathway genes relative to 129S1/SvImJ, which likely explains the sensitivity of the B6 strain to male-to-female sex reversal. Using this time course data, we predicted novel regulatory genes underlying expression QTLs ( eQTLs ) mapped in a previous study. We also developed an in vitro gonad primary cell assay and optimized a lentivirus-based shRNA delivery method to silence candidate genes and quantify effects on putative targets. This approach can be readily applied to identify regulatory interactions in other systems."

The impact of CDTI on the prevalence of loiasis is not known. We, therefore, designed this cross sectional study to explore the effect of several rounds of CDTI on parasitological indicators of loiasis. The study was done in the East, Northwest and Southwest 2 CDTI projects of Cameroon. Ivermectin treatment history was correlated with loiasis prevalence/intensity. A total of 3, 684 individuals were recruited from 36 communities of the 3 CDTI projects and 900 individuals from 9 villages in a non-CDTI district. Ivermectin treatment was reduced from 30. 5% to 17. 9% ( after 9 ivermectin rounds ) but from 8. 1% to 7. 8% ( not significantly different after 14 rounds ). There was a negative relationship between adherence to ivermectin treatment and prevalence/intensity of infection in all sites. None of the children examined in the East CDTI project harboured high ( 8, 000\u201330, 000 mf/ml ) or very high ( >30, 000 mf/ml ) microfilariae. In areas where onchocerciasis and loiasis are co-endemic, CDTI reduces the number of, and microfilaraemia in L. loa-infected individuals, and this, in turn, will help to prevent non-neurological and neurological complications post-ivermectin treatment among CDTI adherents."

This is because RhoG is able to enhance the cellular activity of another host cell protein, SGEF, which is another host cell factor that is known to play a role in the HPV induced cell cycle. We also show that the HPV induced cell cycle is enhanced in the presence of hiales, a second component of the cell's own machinery.

QTL are often assumed to be well characterized, and it is clear that they can be involved in the control of many traits. However, the extent to which different traits are controlled by the same genetic mechanism is not yet known. Here, we investigate the effects of common genetic variants on the ( co ) variance of a number of phenotypic traits in six different environments. We find that the effects of common variants on trait covariance structure ( genetic constraint ) and on genetic constraint and expression of a candidate gene, FT, are unifying. We also identify nFT as a quantitative trait locus, which may be involved in the regulation of flowering time, and the genetic constraint gene Hsp90. We also find evidence that genetic constraint, a major factor in the control of many traits, may also be involved in this process. Our results support the view that ( at least in traits with major signal integrators such as flowering time ) genetic canalization, genetic constraint, and GxE may have related genetic mechanisms resulting from interactions among major QTL, genomic backgrounds, and environments."

We find that, although the average life history of deer is longer than 10 days, the time of birth for a deer can be significantly shorter than the time of parturition. In contrast, we find that the response of deer birth dates to climate change is dependent upon the extent of the warming they are exposed to.

HCMV is believed to encode a protein, UL70, which is believed to be required for viral DNA replication. UL70 is highly conserved among herpesviruses and is believed to encode the primary function of the viral DNA replication machinery. No host factors that facilitate the nuclear import of UL70 have been reported. In this study, we demonstrate that UL70 specifically interacts with a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed member of the heat shock protein Hsp40/DNAJ family, DNAJB6a and DNAJB6b. The interaction of UL70 with DNAJB6a and DNAJB6b was identified by both a two hybrid screen in yeast and coimmunoprecipitation in human cells. In transfected cells, UL70 was primarily co-localized with DNAJB6a in the nuclei and with DNAJB6b in the cytoplasm, respectively. The nuclear import of UL70 was increased in cells in which DNAJB6a was up-regulated or DNAJB6b was down-regulated, and was reduced in cells in which DNAJB6a was down-regulated or DNAJB6b was up-regulated. Moreover, DNAymb6a and b appeared to enhance the cellular accumulation of UL70, which is thought to modulate viral DNA synthesis and lytic infection. Our results also suggest that the relative expression levels of DNAymb6 isoforms may play a key role in regulating the cellular localization of UL70, leading to modulation of HCMV DNA replication and lytic infection."

There were no evidence to support the conclusion that drug treatments were fully curative for schistosomiasis, and that reductions in the intensity of infection could be a means to mitigate morbidity.

Our analysis reveals that individual-level influenza antibody profiles can be explained by a short-lived, broadly cross-reactive response that decays within a year to leave a smaller long-term response against a narrower range of strains. We also demonstrate that accounting for dynamic immune responses alongside infection history can provide a more accurate alternative to traditional definitions of seroconversion for the estimation of infection attack rates.

The model indicates that the combination of multiple modes of coupling does not necessarily facilitate entrainment of the cell cycle by the circadian clock.

One of the factors that determine whether an individual will develop a severe illness is the genetic background, which can have a major impact on the outcome of infection. While it is known that there are many different Ebola virus strains that cause human disease, the molecular basis for this variation is still unclear. We have developed a system for testing the role of a single viral protein in pathogenesis, and we have used this system to study the role of the Ebola virus glycoprotein ( GP ), a protein that is known to be important for the viral replication cycle. We have also developed a novel reverse genetics system for testing the role of GP in the context of viral infection, and we have used this system to examine the role of GP in the context of lethal infection. We found that GP was indeed required for virulence in a mouse model of infection, but that GP alone did not contribute to disease in a human infection model."

We have studied the role of HIF-1\u03b1 in disease resolution in BALB/c ( resistant, cornea heals ) mice after ocular infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, the current studies focused on the neutrophil ( PMN ), the predominant cell infiltrate in keratitis. We found that HIF-1\u03b1 inhibition exacerbated disease and corneal destruction. Real time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, Greiss and MPO assays, bacterial load, intracellular killing, phagocytosis and apoptosis assays further tested the regulatory role of HIF-1\u03b1. Despite increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and increased MPO levels after decreasing HIF-1\u03b1 expression, in vivo studies revealed a decrease in NO production and higher bacterial load. In vitro studies using PMN provided evidence that although inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 does not appear to affect phagocytosis, both bacterial killing and apoptosis were significantly affected. Our data provide evidence that inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 converts a normally resistant disease response to susceptible ( cornea thinning and perforation ) after induction of bacterial keratitis. Although this inhibition does not appear to affect phagocytosis, both in vivo and in vitro approaches indicate that the transcription factor is essential for effective bacterial killing, apoptosis and antimicrobial peptide production."

These distant genes are then treated by RdDM to become associated with the genes involved in the silencing process. This is the first example where the RdDM loci are found in very close proximity to genes. We also found that the frequency of chromosomal interactions at RdDM targets is increased in plants lacking the function of RdDM.

Interestingly, nearly half of the patients displayed moderate defects or osteochondroma-like outgrowths in the cranial base and specifically in the clivus. In good correlation, osteochondromas developed in the cranial base of mutant Ext1f/f mouse models of HME along the synchondrosis growth plates. Osteochondroma formation was preceded by phenotypic alteration of cells at the chondro-perichond boundary and was accompanied by ectopic expression of major cartilage matrix genes -collagen 2 and collagen X- within the growing ectopic masses.

If subcritical, activity can die out, if supercritical epileptiform patterns may occur. We are interested in understanding how developing networks will reach and stabilize criticality. We monitored the development between 13 and 95 days in vitro ( DIV ) of cortical cell cultures ( n\u200a=\u200a20 ) and find four different phases, related to their morphological maturation: An initial low-activity state ( \u224819 DIV ) is followed by a supercritical ( \u224820 DIV ) and then a subcritical one ( \u224836 DIV ) until the network finally reaches stable criticality. Using network modeling and mathematical analysis we describe the emergent connectivity in such developing systems. We predict a specific time course for the maturation of inhibition, with strong onset and delayed pruning, and that total synaptic connectivity should be strongly linked to the relative levels of excitation and inhibition. These results demonstrate that the interplay between activity and connectivity guides developing networks into criticality suggesting that this may be a generic and stable state of many networks in vivo and in vitro."

Here, we report that the mitochondrial genome is significantly altered in RECG KO cells due to a recombination between 8\u201379 bp repeats. The extent of the recombination was dependent on the level of the mitochondrial DNA. Some of the induced recombination was efficient in RECG KO cells, likely due to the high levels of short repeats in the genome. However, others of the recombination events were not efficiently repaired and were often associated with a decrease in the levels of the normal mitochondrial DNA and significant decrease in the number of transcripts derived from the loci.

The ability of P. gingivalis to enhance collagen-induced arthritis was dependent on the expression of a unique P. gingivalis peptidylarginine deiminase ( PPAD ), which converts arginine residues in proteins to citrulline. Infection with wild type P. gingivalis was responsible for significantly increased levels of autoantibodies to collagen type II and citrullinated epitopes as a PPAD-null mutant did not elicit similar host response. High level of citrullinated proteins was also detected at the site of infection with wild-type P. gingivalis.

All nine proteins have two domains: one binds to the substrate; the other to E3 ligase modules Skp1/dependant, E2/ubiquitin, and to Cdc4, Fbs1 and SOCS2. In all cases the flexible inter-domain linker serves as a hinge, rotating the substrate binding domain, optimally and accurately positioning it for ubiquitin transfer. We further observed that the linker flexibility could be regulated allosterically by binding events associated with either domain. Our findings provide a mechanism for ubiquitination and polyubiquitination, illustrating that these processes are under conformational control."

Fish raised in ponds are exposed to FZT infection from snail host species common in fish farms. In this study, we investigated the association between snail population density and FZT infection in snails with the rate of FZT transmission to juvenile fish raised in carp nurseries. Snail population density and prevalence of trematode infections were determined in 48 carp nurseries producing Bohu juveniles, ( Labeo rohita ) in the Red River Delta area. Fish samples were examined at 3, 6 and 9 weeks after the juvenile fish were introduced into the ponds. There was a significant positive correlation between prevalence of FZT metacercariae in juvenile fish and density of infected snails. Thus, the odds of infection in juvenile fish were 4. 36 and 11. 32 times higher for ponds with medium and high density of snails, respectively, compared to ponds where no infected snails were found. This may be due to immigration of cercariae into the pond from external water sources. The total number and density of potential host snails and density of host snails infected with heterophyid trematodes in the aquaculture pond is a useful predictor for infections in juvenile fish, although infection levels in juvenile fish can occur despite low density or absence infected snails. This suggests that intervention programs to control FZT infection of fish should include not only intra-pond snail control, but also water sources of allochthonous cercariae, i. e. canals supplying water to ponds as well as snail habitats outside the pond such as rice fields and surrounding ponds."

High Scr expression in defined domains of the T1 leg is required for the development of T1-specific transverse bristle rows in both sexes and sex combs in males, implying that the patterning of segment- and sex-specific sense organs involves incorporation of Scr into the leg development and sex determination gene networks. We have identified two cis-regulatory elements that control spatially modulated Scr expression within T1 legs. One of these enhancers directs sexually dimorphic expression and is required for the formation of T1-specific bristle patterns. We show that the Distalless and Engrailed homeodomain transcription factors act through sequences in this enhancer to establish elevated Scr expression in spatially defined domains.

Furthermore, we found that the immune response to RV infection was suppressed by the degradation of a protein of the immune system, called IRAK-1. These observations demonstrate that RV infection can inhibit the immune response, and that the immune response to RV infection is dependent on the protein IRAK-1.

This sRNA is encoded by the gene ecpR1, which is widely conserved in at least five families of the Rhizobiales and is predicted to form a stable structure with two defined stem-loop domains. We also show that this sRNA promotes degradation of the DNA damage response regulator gcrA and DNA damage tolerance. Our results provide evidence for a function of sRNA in modulating the cell cycle in response to environmental stimuli."

It is known that P. vivax is an intracellular parasite, but it is not yet fully understood which specific epitopes are recognized by the immune system and which antibodies are induced to control the infection. In this work, we investigated the interaction of a specific P. vivax protein, P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein ( PvDBPII ), with two receptors of the host immune system, the human leukocyte antigen receptor for chemokines ( HLA-B ) and the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines ( DARC ). We found that four different variants of PvDBPII could be used to probe the interaction and that only one of them, in addition to its glycosylation on the surface of the protein, elicited better antibody responses. We also found that the interaction site for the glycosylated form of the protein ( which is called DARC ) was strongly dependent on the presence of the glycan on the protein surface. Our results demonstrate that glycan masking is an attractive and feasible strategy to investigate the molecular basis of the interaction between P. vivax and the human immune system."

During latency, EBV is maintained in a cycle of lytic replication and latency. During lytic replication, the EBV immediate-early ( IE ) protein BZLF1 ( Z ) activates expression of the BQQ1 and BRRF1 viral proteins, which in turn activate the viral immediate-early gene. EBV also activates expression of the Bqs1 and BRRF1 proteins, which are themselves activated by methylated forms of the viral immediate-early promoter ( Rp ). Here, we demonstrate that the promoter driving transcription of the early BRRF1 gene ( nap ) has two CpG-containing ZREs ( ACGCTCA and TCGCCCG ) that are only bound by Z in the methylated state. Both ZREs are highly methylated in cells with latent EBV infection. Z efficiently activates the methylated form of Nap in reporter gene assays, and both ZREs are required. Molecular modeling studies of Z bound to the methylated nap ZREs help to explain why methylation is required for Z binding, and the role of the Z Ser186 residue. Methylation-dependent Z binding to critical viral promoters may enhance lytic reactivation in latently infected cells, where the viral genome is heavily methylated. Conversely, since the incoming viral genome is initially unmethylated, methylation-dependent Z activation may also help the virus to establish latency following infection."

TSPyV is one of the five members of the polyomavirus family that are directly linked to a human disease, however, details about molecular recognition events, the viral entry pathway, and intracellular trafficking events during TSPyV infection remain unknown. Here, we have used a structure-function approach to shed light on the first steps of TSPyV infection. We established by cell binding and pseudovirus infection studies that TSPyV interacts with sialic acids during attachment and/or entry. We also solved high-resolution X-ray structures of the major capsid protein VP1 of TSPyV in complex with three different glycans. The terminal sialic acid of all three glycans is engaged in a unique binding site on TSPyV VP1. Mutation of sialic acid-binding residues leads to reduction in cell attachment and pseudovirus infection, demonstrating the physiological relevance of the TSPyV VP1-glycan interaction. Furthermore, treatments of cells with inhibitors of glycolipid synthesis, and glycosphingolipid synthesis, suggest that glycolipids play an important role during TSPyV infection. Our findings elucidate the first molecular recognition events of cellular infection with TSPyV and demonstrate that receptor recognition by polyomaviruses is highly variable not only in interactions with sialic acid itself, but also in the location of the binding site."

Paradoxically, the viral proteins that are responsible for this coordination are not themselves produced late in infection. The mechanism by which late proteins are produced is unknown. Here, we show that the expression of HSV1 late proteins is regulated by the action of two viral proteins, vhs and VP22, which function to recruit the viral replicative machinery. We find that vhs is essential for the production of late proteins, but its activity is not required for the production of early proteins. In addition, VP22 is necessary for late protein production. Collectively, these results demonstrate that vhs and its co-factors, VP22 and VP16, function in a coordinated manner to promote late protein production, and thereby to ensure a constant supply of late proteins to the viral replicative machinery."

Many pathogens have evolved strategies to subvert or evade the immune response and to modulate the immune response.

In this context, interferon ( IFN-I ), a type I interferon, is crucial to protect the host against intracellular pathogens. However, it is unclear whether production of IFN-I is generally attributable to IFN-I-producing cells or to the mode of IFN-I mobilization. We have studied the production of IFN-I in mice infected with Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis. We show that IFN-I is amplified via IFN-\u03b2, the IFN-I receptor, and the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 7 ( IRF7 ), a molecular circuitry typically characteristic of non-pDC-producing cells. IFN-I production does not depend on TLR9. In contrast, in vitro\u2013differentiated pDC infected with L. monocytogenes, IFN-I synthesis is mediated by the IFN-I receptor. Consistent with the assumption that pDC are the producers of systemic IFN-I, the data suggest that the engagement of pDC, the mode of IFN-I mobilization, as well as the shaping of the antimicrobial innate immune response by IFN-I differ between intracellular pathogens."

Here, we review potential vaccine candidates and discuss the cost-benefit of different vaccination strategies. We developed a cost-effectiveness analysis model that showed that a vaccine could be a cost-effective intervention in Thailand, particularly if used in high-risk populations such as diabetics. Cost-effectiveness was observed in a model in which only partial immunity was assumed. The review systematically summarized all the existing vaccine candidates and studies in animal models, which showed that a vaccine could be a cost-effective tool for a specific disease. Live-attenuated vaccines were not considered favorably because of possible reversion to virulence and hypothetical risk of latent infection, while the other candidates require further development and evaluation.

In this study, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans model organism to investigate how defects in TRMU, GTPBP3 and MTO1 orthologues ( designated as mttu-1, mtcu-1, and mtcu-2, respectively ) exert their effects. We found that mutations in mtcu-1 or mtcu-2 cause changes in the expression of metabolic and mitochondrial stress response genes that are quite different from those caused by mttu-1 mutations. Our data suggest that retrograde signaling promotes defect-specific metabolic reprogramming, which is able to rescue the OXPHOS dysfunction in the single mutants by stimulating the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle flux through complex II. This adaptive response, however, appears to be associated with a biological cost since the single mutant worms exhibit thermosensitivity and decreased fertility. Notably, mttu-1; mttu-1 double mutants display severe growth defects and sterility. The animal models presented here support the idea that the pathological states in humans may initially develop not as a direct consequence of a bioenergetic defect, but from the cell\u2019s maladaptive response to the hypomodification status of mt-tRNAs.

However, little is known about the endogenous regulators of these Th2 immune responses. In this study, we have determined whether IL-27, a cytokine that regulates Th2 responses, is involved in limiting the development of pathogenic Th2 immune responses during infection with the murine parainfluenza virus Sendai virus ( SeV ). Mice lacking IL-27 had increased lung inflammation, severe lung lesions, and decreased survival compared to controls. We also found that IL-27-deficient mice had increased pulmonary eosinophils, alternatively activated macrophages ( AAMs ), and the emergence of Th2 immune responses. We also found that IL-27-deficient mice had reduced Th2 immune responses and decreased disease severity compared to controls. These data indicate that endogenous IL-27 limits Th2 immune responses by regulating the quality of CD4+ T cell responses and therefore may have therapeutic potential in paramyxovirus infections."

We previously demonstrated that brain microvessel cells from infected mice cross-present antigens to T cells, which were then used to study the process of antigen processing in the brain. We now show that brain endothelial cells, not pericytes or microglia, are responsible for cross-presentation of antigen by CD8+ T cells in vivo and in vitro.

Blocking IFN\u03b3 stimulation of endothelial cells, or the replication of parasite in brain endothelial cells, resulted in decreased phagocytosis of P. falciparum merozoites.

This interaction interface is usually the interface between the two proteins and the cell, and is a major site for the formation of the protein-protein interaction. Understanding how this interface is formed is a fundamental problem in biology, and many efforts have been done to model this interface. We have used a novel computational technique to analyze the interactions of an important protein, AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ), with a known protein interaction interface. We found that the autoinhibitory domain ( AID ), which is present in many other proteins, is able to inhibit AMPK by preventing the open conformation of the kinase domain from entering the AMPK pocket. This prevents structural rearrangements of the AMPK domain in the unproductive open conformation, thereby limiting the local structural rearrangement and global interlobe conformational transition. Our results also show that the AMPK auto-inhibitory domain is not essential for the catalytic function of AMPK, and it is not necessary for the global interference of the AID with AMPK."

The results of these comparative analyses highlight the existence of intimate links between the propensity of proteins to form aggregates with \u03b2-structure and their biology.

These proteins are called transcriptional repressors. They are responsible for repression of gene expression, which is often achieved by altering the expression levels of thousands of genes. We have recently discovered that a group of transcriptional repressors called KRAB\u2013ZFPs are able to repress gene expression at hundreds of different genes. This repression is mediated by the action of a transcription factor called KAP1, which is required for the repression of genes located several kilobases away from the DNA binding sites of KRAB\u2013ZFPs. Here, we show that this repression is established through the long-range spreading of heterochromatin, a repressive chromatin structure that is present in the human genome. We further show that this mechanism is conserved in the human genome, as we identify the transcription factor KAP1 as a new target of KRAB\u2013ZFPs. This finding provides important new insights into the function of KRAB\u2013ZFPs, and also helps to interpret future genome-wide DNA binding data of KRAB\u2013ZFPs and KAP1."

We show that the latent reservoir is maintained in the face of viral replication in patients on HAART. Furthermore, we show that the number of infected cells is very small compared to the number of latent cells. Thus, the latent reservoir is unlikely to be directly related to the ongoing viral replication. Thus, the number of infected cells remains a stable reservoir even in the presence of HAART.

High levels of SIRT1 in HPV-infected cells reduce the activity of the DNA damage response, and also the expression of the transcription factor Rad51, which is required for viral replication. SIRT1 binds multiple regions of the HPV genome and this may contribute to the regulation of viral replication and gene expression.

The 5\u2032-end of viral RNAs, which is important for mRNA stability, translation and viral immune escape, is methylated at guanosine-N7 and ribose 2\u2032-O positions, catalyzed by two SARS coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) methyltransferases that are encoded by two distinct genes, nsp16 and nsp10, respectively. A unique feature for SARS-CoV is that nsp16 requires non-structural protein nsp10 as a stimulatory factor to execute its methyltransferase activity. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of nsp16/nsp10 complex and its crystal structure. We demonstrated that nsp16 MTase methylates m7GpppA-RNA but not m7GpppG-RNA, which is in contrast to nsp14 MTase that functions in a sequence-independent manner. We also determined the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex with methyl donor SAM. Nsp16 possesses the canonical scaffold of MTase and associates with nsp10 at 1\u22361 ratio. The structure of the nsp16/nsp10 interaction interface shows that nsp10 may stabilize the SAM-binding pocket and extend the substrate RNA-binding groove of nsp16, consistent with the findings in biochemical assays. These results suggest that nsp16/nsp10 interface may represent a better drug target than the viral MTase active site for developing highly specific anti-coronavirus drugs."

We have identified the first case of hypersensitivity to the catabolism of HC, a key virulence effector of Cochliobolus carbonum race 1 ( CCR1 ). The hypomorphic allele of Hm1, which encodes an NADPH-dependent reductase, was found to be completely protective against disease in all three developmental stages, but the mechanism of protection was not known. We have found that the hypomorphic Hm1A, which encodes an NADPH-dependent reductase, is unable to fully protect against disease in all three developmental stages. Furthermore, the hypomorphic Hm1A is unable to protect against disease in all three developmental stages. No difference in accumulation of the HC-toxin catabolism was observed between adult and juvenile plants, suggesting that the susceptibility of seedlings to the disease is a result of a greater need for HPTR activity, not reduced accumulation of the gene product. Conditions and treatments that altered the photosynthetic output of the host had a dramatic effect on resistance imparted by the hypomorphic Hm1A alleles, demonstrating a link between the energetic or metabolic status of the host and disease resistance affected by HC-toxin catabolism by the hypersensitive alleles of Hm1."

We sampled aquatic organisms from 32 communities of aquatic macro-invertebrates and vertebrates in two BU endemic regions in Cameroon during 12 months. As a result, 238, 496 individuals were classified and MU presence was assessed by quantitative PCR. Our results showed a broad distribution of MU in all ecosystems and taxonomic groups, and important regional differences in its occurrence. Colonization dynamics fluctuated along the year, with the highest peaks in August and October. The large variations observed in the colonization dynamics of different taxonomic groups and aquatic ecosystems suggest that the trends shown here are the result of complex ecological processes that need further investigation. This study provides the first detailed description of MU ecology in aquatic ecosystems. We argue that coupling this data with fine-scale epidemiological data through statistical and mathematical models will provide a major step forward in the understanding of MU ecology and mode of transmission."

However, how metazoans control nucleolar size remains largely unknown. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a good model to address this question owing to distinct tissue distribution of nucleolar sizes and a mutant, ncl-1, which exhibits larger nucleoli than wild-type worms. Through a series of loss-of-function analyses, we report that the nucleolar size is regulated by a circuitry composed of microRNA let-7, translation repressor NCL-1, and a major nucleolar pre-rRNA processing protein FIB-1/fibrillarin. In cooperation with RNA binding proteins PUF and NOS, NCL-1 suppressed the translation of FIB-1/fibrillarin, while let-7 targeted the 3\u2019UTR of ncl-1 and inhibited its expression. Consequently, the abundance of FIB-1 is tightly controlled and correlated with the nucleolar size.

The development of an antibody that can protect against all known HIV strains is therefore a significant step forward in the field. We used a rhesus macaque animal model to improve the delivery of naturally-arising, antiviral antibodies that target a region of the HIV envelope protein. We found that these antibodies were universally strong, and that the antibody response to a limited number of injections was universally strong. While the antibody response to the natural antigen was only detected in about 20% of animals, the antibody response to the immunoglobulin vector was detected in only 20% of animals.

The question that has remained unanswered is how this mitochondrial arrangement affects the way mitochondria interact and how it influences the metabolic processes of the cell. We address this question by employing computer simulations of the cardiac cell to model the behaviour of the mitochondrial matrix in these simulations. Our simulations show that mitochondrial structures can lead to spatial variations in the concentrations of inorganic phosphate, creatine ( Cr ), and creatine phosphate ( PCr ). This causes significant spatial variation in concentrations of these metabolites across the cell. Our results also show that, under low oxygen levels, mitochondrial function is not sufficient to account for this variation.

Mutations in flapwing ( flw ), a catalytic subunit of myosin phosphatase, result in non-muscle myosin hyperphosphorylation, as well as muscle hypercontraction, defects in size, motility, muscle attachment, and subsequent larval and pupal lethality. We show that moderately elevated expression of the IAC protein PINCH significantly rescues flw phenotypes. Rescue requires PINCH be bound to its partners, Integrin-linked kinase and Ras suppressor 1. Rescue is not achieved through dephosphorylation of non-muscle myosin, suggesting a mechanism in which elevated PINCH expression strengthens integrin adhesion. Moreover, in support of this, elevated expression of PINCH can rescue an independent muscle hypercontraction mutant in muscle myosin heavy chain. These data are consistent with a model in which PINCH is present in limiting amounts within IACs, with increasing PINCH expression reinforcing existing adhesion or allowing for the de novo assembly of new IACs.

The blood coagulation factors ( II, VII, VIII, IX and X ), protein C and antithrombin IIa ( ATIIa ) levels were also assessed. We found that the blood coagulation factors ( II, VII, VIII, IX and X ), protein C and antithrombin IIa levels were significantly lower in patients compared to controls ( n\u200a=\u200a29 ), including raised serum transaminases ( p<0. 001 ) and lower levels of albumin ( p\u200a=\u200a0. 0156 ). Additionally, patients with more advanced fibrosis ( n\u200a=\u200a38 ) had lower levels of protein C compared to those with only central fibrosis ( p\u200a=\u200a0. 0124 ). We conclude that hemostatic abnormalities are associated with reduced liver function and increased liver fibrosis. Of interest is the finding that a quarter of patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and advanced periportal fibrosis have hyperfibrinolysis, which may predispose them to gastrointestinal bleeding."

Such \u201cblack box\u201d ranking algorithms can either be used to increase the risk prediction, or as a model that can be studied to better understand the mechanism of the disease. Here, we improve current risk predictors by combining them with a novel statistical method called BootRank.

We analyzed a series of 23 HTLV-1 strains from Indigenous Australian populations to determine the genetic diversity of these strains.

One group of Australian strains was found in the North and the second group was found in the South of central Australia. Our results suggest that the speciation of these two Australian clades occurred 9, 120 years ago ( 38, 000\u20134, 500 ). The HTLV-1c subtype is endemic to central Australia where the Indigenous population is infected with diverse subtype c variants. At least two Australian clades exist, which are probably of very ancient origin.

We have found that a host cellular protein called ORF45 associates with cellular lipid rafts and promotes the recruitment of KSHV particles to the budding site by targeting them to the lipid rafts. This function of ORF45 is dependent on its mono-ubiquitylation at a specific residue, which is important for the recruitment of KSHV particles to the budding site. This mutation abolishes ORF45\u2019s ability to target lipid rafts, impairing ORF45\u2019s recruitment to the virus particle and its maturation.

In recent years, large-scale proteome sequencing projects have been generated for a wide range of organisms. However, existing interactome maps are far from complete. To resolve this shortcoming, many approaches have been developed to find interactions between proteins by co-migration. These approaches typically only identify a subset of the total interaction between two proteins. However, in practice, these methods can be biased by the presence of other genomic features such as gene regulatory sequences, which are known to affect protein-protein interactions. Here, we take a detailed analysis of genomic data integration to assess the effect of this type of bias on interactome mapping. We find that genomic data integration leads to an increase in the functional coherence of the resulting interactome maps, but this comes at the expense of a decrease in power to discover novel interactions. We also find that putative novel interactions predicted by genomic data integration are no more likely to later be experimentally discovered than those predicted from co-migration data alone. Our results reveal a widespread and unappreciated limitation in a methodology that has been widely used to map the interactome of humans and model organisms."

HENMT1 loss causes piRNA instability and shortening of the piRNA biosynthetic pathway and results in the germ cell arrest at the elongating germ cell stage. We show that HENMT1 loss leads to piRNA instability, reduced piRNA bulk, and length, and that piRNA instability is required for the expression of many piRNAs. piRNA instability and expression of many piRNAs are associated with the chromatin state of meiotic cells, elevated levels of DNA damage, and a dramatic deregulation of the haploid germ cell gene expression.

This includes proteins with a structure different from other exported proteins, and we show that the first 20 amino acids of these proteins are sufficient to promote export of a reporter. Unexpectedly, we found that the same region of proteins from other exported proteins, the PEXEL/HT proteins, is required to move from the PV into the host cell. We also took advantage of newly found soluble PEXEL/HT proteins to show that this type of exported protein requires unfolding to move from the PV to the host cell.

Our observation that BSOr mutants are more heat resistant and need less GSH than wt virus to be protected from heat inactivation suggests that they possess a more stable capsid. We propose that the role of GSH during enterovirus morphogenesis is to stabilize capsid structures by direct interaction with capsid proteins both during and after the formation of mature virus particles."

Most of the currently available malaria vaccines are based on antigens derived from the parasite's surface proteins. The P. vivax Apical Membrane Antigen 1 ( PvAMA1 ) is a promising vaccine candidate, however it is unclear which regions in the parasite are targeted by the immune system and which regions are naturally targeted by immunity. We studied the diversity of PvAMA1 to assess its feasibility as a vaccine candidate. We analysed 8 different sequences from Papua New Guinea, India, Sri Lanka, Venezuela and a collection of isolates from disparate geographic locations. We found that the parasite has a very high degree of genetic diversity, which suggests that it is a dominant target of immune responses. However, there was considerable geographic differentiation between the genetic diversity and antigenic diversity of the parasite. Our analyses also revealed that the majority of the parasite is polymorphic, but the 210 distinct haplotypes we identified represent only common polymorphisms. The 210 haplotypes comprised of only common polymorphisms were grouped into eleven clusters, suggesting that this parasite is a good model for the diverse antigenic diversity it encodes. These results will help to understand the antigenic diversity of this molecule and to make an important contribution to the ongoing goal of malaria vaccines."

Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) are a family of transmembrane receptors that detect intracellular viral particles and initiate the immune response. TLRs are also involved in a variety of other biological processes, including the development of atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration and immune cell function. However, the role of TLRs in the control of viral infections remains poorly defined. Here, we used a mouse model of Friend virus ( FV ), which causes a disease similar to human retroviral infection. We found that deletion of TLR7 in dendritic cell ( DC ) and B cell lineages had little effect on immune control of FV. We then identified TLR7 as being required for antibody-mediated control of FV by analyzing mice lacking TLR7. Deletion of TLR7 in B cells did not affect immune control, but B cell-intrinsic TLR signaling was required to control development of germinal center B cells. Furthermore, we found that CD4 T cell responses were TLR7 independent and that CD8 T cell responses were TLR7 independent, suggesting the existence of additional TLR pathways for detection of viral particles. These results demonstrate that the vertebrate immune system detects retroviruses in vivo via TLR7 and that this pathway regulates a key checkpoint controlling development of germinal center B cells."

Here we report a comprehensive analysis of non-CpG methylation in 76 genome-scale DNA methylation maps across pluripotent and differentiated human cell types. We confirm non-CpG methylation to be predominantly present in pluripotent cell types and show a decrease upon differentiation and near complete absence in various somatic cell types. Although no function has been assigned to it in pluripotency, our data highlight that non-CpG methylation patterns reappeared upon iPS cell reprogramming. Intriguingly, the patterns are highly variable and show little conservation between different pluripotent cell lines. We find a strong correlation of non-CpG methylation and DNMT3 expression levels, while showing statistical independence of non-CpG methylation from pluripotency associated gene expression.

However, it has recently been shown that during the initial phase of infection virus-specific CD8+ T cells express high levels of PD-1, but are fully competent in killing virus-infected target cells. We have analyzed the expression of PD-L1 on retrovirus-infected cells and found that PD-L1 expression levels were increased after infection of cells with the murine Friend retrovirus or with HIV. In FV infected mice, virus-specific CTLs efficiently eliminated infected target cells that expressed low levels of PD-L1 or that were deficient for PD-L1 but the population of PD-L1high cells escaped elimination and formed a reservoir for chronic FV replication. Infected cells with high PD-L1 expression mediated a negative feedback on CD8+ T cells and inhibited their expansion and cytotoxic functions. These findings provide evidence for a novel immune escape mechanism during acute retroviral infection based on PD-L1 expression levels on virus infected target cells."

This is because seed size is a trait that allows plants to colonise new ecological niches, which can subsequently influence the ecology of the species that they inhabit. However, seed size does not appear to be a trait that is strongly linked to speciation, because plants with larger seed sizes are more likely to diversify. Our study reveals that variation in seed size and the rate of change in seed size are two different types of underlying cause of speciation."

The chronic infection is initiated by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi ( TcP2\u00df ), which is able to survive for many years in the body. Chronic Chagas disease is characterized by high levels of antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal region of TcP2\u00df ( TcP2\u00df ). This region of the parasite is recognized by antibodies, as well as by a mouse monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) that can cross react with TcP2\u00df and stimulates the \u00df1 adrenergic receptor. Indeed, the mAb 17. 2 was able to detect human \u03b21-AR, stably transfected into HEK cells, by flow cytometry and to induce repolarisation abnormalities and first degree atrioventricular conduction block after passive transfer to na\u00efve mice. We performed crystal structure of the Fab region of the mAb 17. 2 alone at 2. 31 \u00c5 resolution and in complex with the R13 peptide at 1. 89 \u00c5 resolution. We identified key contact residues on R13 peptide Glu3, Asp6 and Phe9 as was previously shown by alanine scanning. Additionally, we generated a model of human \u03b21-AR to elucidate the interaction with anti-R13 antibodies. These data provide an understanding of the molecular basis of cross-reactive antibodies induced by chronic infection with Trypanosoma cruzi."

The global program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis currently uses mass drug administration ( MDA ) to treat all individuals in endemic countries. In this study, we examined whether MDA has a health benefit by monitoring acute morbidity in Papua New Guinean communities that participated in a 5-year MDA trial. weekly active surveillance for acute filariasis morbidity defined by painful swelling of the extremities, scrotum and breast was performed 1 year before and each year after 4 annual MDA treatments. Acute morbidity events lasted <3 weeks in 92% of affected individuals and primarily involved the leg ( 74\u201379% of all annual events ). The incidence for all communities considered together decreased from 0. 39 per year to 0. 31, 0. 15, 0. 19 and 0. 20 after each of 4 treatments. Residents of communities with high pre-treatment transmission intensities ( 224\u2013740 infective bites/year ) experienced a greater reduction in acute morbidity ( 0. 62 episodes per year pre-treatment vs. 0. 30 in the 4th post-treatment year ) than residents of communities with moderate pre-treatment transmission intensities ( 24\u2013167 infective bites/year; 0. 28 episodes per year pre-treatment vs. 0. 16 in the 4th post-treatment year ). Mass administration of anti-filarial drugs results in immediate health benefit by decreasing the incidence of acute attacks of leg and arm swelling in people with pre-existing infection. Reduction in acute filariasis morbidity parallels decreased transmission intensity, suggesting that continuing exposure to infective mosquitoes is involved in the pathogenesis of acute filariasis morbidity."

In this study we investigated the role of sst1 in regulating the immune response to C. pneumoniae infection. We found that C. pneumoniae is a better pathogen than the bacterium that replicates inside macrophages, which are the primary immune sentinels. Infection of macrophages with C. pneumoniae results in an increased secretion of interferon-\u03b2 and interleukin-10, which are pro-inflammatory cytokines. This interferon-mediated immune response is dependent on the secretion of interferon-\u03b2. Interestingly macrophages from the sst1 susceptible mouse model of infection were not able to support chlamydial growth, resulting in arrested development and failure of the organism to complete its infectious cycle. We conclude that the sst1 locus is a regulator of a common immune defense mechanism against diverse intracellular bacterial pathogens."

In Arabidopsis thaliana, regulators of floral determinacy include several transcription factor genes, such as APETALA2 ( AP2 ), AGAMOUS ( AG ), Superiales ( SUP ), and CRABSCLAW ( CRC ), as well as a microRNA ( miRNA ), miR172, which targets AP2. How the transcription factor and miRNA genes are coordinately regulated to achieve floral determinacy is unknown. Here we found that a mutation in POWERDRESS ( PWR ), a previously uncharacterized gene encoding a SANT-domain-containing protein, was isolated in this study as an enhancer of the weakly indeterminate ag-10 allele. PWR was found to promote the transcription of CRC, MIR172a, b, and c, and/or enhance Pol II occupancy at their promoters, without affecting MIR172d or e. A mutation in mature miR172d was additionally found to enhance the determinacy defects of ag-10 in an AP2-dependent manner, providing direct evidence that miR172d is functional in repressing AP2 and thereby contributes to floral determinacy. Thus, while PWR promotes floral determinacy by enhancing the expression of three of the five MIR172 members, it also functions in the termination of the stem cells. These findings demonstrate how transcriptional diversification and functional redundancy of a miRNA family, along with PWR-mediated co-regulation of transcription factor and miRNA genes, contribute to the robustness of the floral determinacy network."

The results showed that FCT was significantly shorter for the latter ( 95 versus 88 hours, respectively, p = 0\u00b7004 ), and this effect was exhibited in both the hospitalized and the outpatient sub-groups.

In this paper, we examined patterns of genetic variation in two sister species, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii, both efficient natural vectors of human malaria in West Africa. We used a molecular method to distinguish between the two species based on the genetic differences they shared. We tested a panel of immune genes in the two sister species to identify genes with immune profiles consistent with the two species' evolutionary history and function in the mosquito. The genes that displayed the most consistent immune profiles were then used to design a screen for the genes that displayed the most consistent immune profiles. The results were then used to identify new genes that might have been involved in the evolution of the mosquito to escape the immune system. We also found that the genes with the most consistent immune profiles are the most likely to be involved in the specific immune response that controls the mosquito."

Our models assume contrasting scenarios of the yellow fever transmission cycle in Africa. The first takes the force of infection in each province to be static across the observation period; this is synonymous with a constant infection pressure from the sylvatic reservoir. The second model assumes the majority of transmission results from the urban cycle; in this case, the force of infection is dynamic and defined through a fixed value of R0 in each province. Both models are coupled to a generalised linear model of yellow fever occurrence which uses environmental covariates to allow us to estimate transmission intensity in areas where data is sparse.

In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of abnormal myelin permeability in an in vivo model of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure pipes ( HNPP ). We observed a robust increase of F-actin in Pmp22+/- nerve regions where myelin junctions were disrupted, leading to increased myelin permeability. These abnormalities were present long before segmental demyelination at the late phase of Pmp22+/- mice. Moreover, the increase of F-actin levels correlated with an enhanced activity of PAK1, a molecule known to regulate actin polymerization. Pharmacological inhibition of PAK prevented the progression of the myelin junction disruption and nerve conduction failure in Pmp22+/- mice. Our findings explain how abnormal myelin permeability is caused in HNPP, leading to impaired action potential propagation in the absence of demyelination.

We retrieved 760 cases of VL/HIV coinfection, most prevalent in adult males, and incidence ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 07 cases, per 100. 000 population, in 2001 and 2010, respectively. Case-fatality rates were 27. 3% in 2001 and 23. 2% in 2010. Weakness, weight loss, cough, other associated infections and haemorrhagic phenomena were more commonly found among coinfected patients, which had a fatality rate three times higher as compared to the non-coinfected group. The results found herein contribute to the increase of knowledge of the epidemiological situation of VL/HIV coinfection in Brazil and reinforce the necessity of implementing specific strategies to improve early case detection and efficacious and less toxic treatment in order to achieve lower case-fatality rates."

They have been a major force behind the evolution of host genomes, with transposable elements often driving the evolution of host defenses. The Piwi-interacting RNA ( piRNA ) pathway is a defense system of the germline of animals that defends the germline from selfish transposable elements. The F1 offspring of crosses between strains of the same Drosophila species often show that the piRNA pathway is inactivated, which is consistent with the role of piRNAs in restricting selfish transposable elements. Here, we compare the piRNA pathway in the F1 hybrids of interspecific crosses between D. melanogaster and D. simulans and find that interspecific hybrids are characterized by widespread derepression of both maternally and paternally inherited TE families. Furthermore, we demonstrate that interspecific hybrids are characterized by widespread derepression of TE families that cannot be explained by the piRNA pathway of the piRNA alone. Rather, we find that interspecific hybrids are characterized by widespread derepression of both maternally and paternally inherited TE families. We suggest that TE derepression in interspecific hybrids largely reflects adaptive divergence of piRNA pathway genes rather than species-specific differences in TE-derived piRNAs."

HBV replicates from a covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) that remains as an episome within the nucleus of infected cells. The regulatory protein HBx has been shown to be essential for cccDNA transcription in the context of infection. Here we identified Spindlin1, a cellular Tudor-domain protein, as an HBx interacting partner. We further demonstrated that Spindlin1 is recruited to the cccDNA and inhibits its transcription in the context of infection. Spindlin1 knockdown induced an increase in HBV transcription and in histone H4K4 trimethylation at the cccDNA, suggesting that Spindlin1 impacts on epigenetic regulation. Spindlin1-induced transcriptional inhibition was greater for the HBV virus deficient for the expression of HBx than for the HBV WT virus, suggesting that HBx counteracts Spindlin1 repression. Importantly, the repressive role of Spindlin1 is not limited to HBV transcription but also extends to other DNA virus that replicate within the nucleus such as Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ). Our results identify Spindlin1 as a critical component of the intrinsic antiviral defense and shed new light on the function of HBx in HBV infection."

Light and temperature cues are both essential for this response, and plants have evolved mechanisms to monitor changes in light and temperature. The phytochrome photoreceptors, which are responsible for detecting light, activate a set of genes that generate the pigments needed to make the pigment they make. One of these genes is PIFs, negative regulators of chlorophyll biosynthesis, which are themselves controlled by light. Here we show that by directly targeting a common promoter cis-element, HY5 and PIFs, the transcription factor Long HYPOCOTYL 5 ( HY5 ), which is known to activate chlorophyll biosynthesis, also functions as an antagonist of PIFs. We demonstrate that upon sudden changes in light or temperature conditions, HY5 and PIFs become activated simultaneously and that this antagonism is specific to light, but not temperature. This allows a rapid, simple, direct mechanism through which light can redirect control of photosynthetic gene expression."

We combined experimental evolution of the bacterial biocontrol agent Bacillus thuringiensis and its nematode host Caenorhabditis elegans with large-scale phenotyping, whole genome analysis, and functional genetics to demonstrate the selective benefit of pathogen virulence and its genes during the adaptation process. We show that pathogen virulence and its genes are highly selective during coevolution rather than one-sided adaptation. Moreover, high virulence in the BT-679 dominated populations was specifically swept to fixation in all of the replicate populations under coevolution but only some under one-sided adaptation. This suggests that, in contrast to unidirectional adaptation, rapid coevolutionary change is not necessarily accompanied by a fitness advantage; rather, it may be the product of a more rapid adaptive response in the host. We also show that toxin genes involved in rapid coevolution are the primary virulence genes during adaptation. Our results therefore highlight that rapid coevolution does not necessarily evolve to be a major driver of biological innovation."

The X-chromosome, which is found in males, has been shown to be a major cause of inviability in hybrid males. However, the extent to which the X-chromosome contributes to hybrid inviability in hybrid females has not been fully elucidated. Here, we study the effects of a small panel of small fragments of the X-chromosome carried on the D. melanogaster Y-chromosome in three kinds of hybrid males. We find that the X-chromosome from D. melanogaster carries dominant alleles that are lethal in hybrids, and that these alleles are revealed only in the most divergent hybrid. We then compare these effects on hybrid viability with two D. melanogaster intraspecific crosses. Unlike the interspecific crosses, we find no X-linked alleles that cause lethality in intraspecific crosses. Our results reveal the existence of dominant alleles on the X-chromosome of D. melanogaster which cause lethality in three different interspecific hybrids. These alleles only cause inviability in hybrid males, but have little effect in hybrid females. This suggests that X-chromosome interactions might be important for males to be healthy, but not for females."

In this study, we investigated the transcriptional control of carbohydrate metabolism in C. albicans and identified two factors, Tye7p and Gal4p, as key regulators of glycolysis. When respiration was inhibited or oxygen was limited, a gal4tye7 strain showed a severe growth defect and a reduced capacity to cause disease in both mice and humans. Gal4p also bound the glycolytic promoter sequences and activated the genes. Intriguingly, Tye7p and Gal4p were responsible for the complete induction of the glycolytic genes under hypoxic growth conditions. Tye7p and Gal4p also regulated unique carbohydrate metabolic genes; Tye7p bound and activated genes involved in trehalose, glycogen, and glycerol metabolism, while Gal4p bound and activated genes involved in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Our results suggest that Tye7p and Gal4p are key transcriptional regulators of carbohydrate metabolism in C. albicans and Gal4p provides a carbon source-dependent fine-tuning of gene expression while regulating the metabolic flux between respiration and fermentation pathways."

Our data indicate that PDK1 is required for the attenuation of the protein kinase PDK1 in the cytoplasm and for the repression of the transcription factor ATS in the nucleus.

The drug of choice for treatment of this disease is the two drugs N-[4-pyridyl]-formamide ( NPy ), which carries the cysteine moiety of ergosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase ( CYP51 ). This enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of membrane sterols, which are major constituents of the cell membrane. The two molecules bind to NPy, forming a complex that is able to inhibit the function of the enzyme. In this paper, we report that two compounds have potent inhibitory effects against T. cruzi in vitro and show that one of them has potent and selectivity in vivo. We also describe that the inhibitor is more efficient against the closely related parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. We also present a crystal structure of CYP51 bound to the inhibitor, which shows that both compounds bind to different sites on the inhibitor's active site. Together, our results suggest that the inhibitor has excellent potency and specificity and could be used in combination with other drugs for Chagas' disease."

Local inputs and modifications to this network allow serial homologs to evolve different morphologies, but currently we do not understand which modifications allow these repeated traits to evolve different levels of phenotypic plasticity. Here we describe variation in phenotypic plasticity across serial homologous eyespots of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, hypothesized to be under selection for similar or different functions in the wet and dry seasonal forms. Specifically, we document the presence of eyespot size and scale brightness plasticity in hindwing eyespots hypothesized to vary in function across seasons, and reduced size plasticity and absence of brightness plasticity in forewing eyespots hypothesized to have the same function across seasons. We demonstrate that temperature experienced during the wandering stages of larval development alters titers of an ecdysteroid hormone, 20E, in the hemolymph of wet and dry seasonal forms at that stage; 2 ) the 20E receptor ( EcR ) is differentially expressed in the forewing and hindwing eyespot centers of both seasonal forms during this critical developmental stage; and 3 ) manipulations of EcR disproportionately affected hindwing eyespots relative to forewing eyespots. We propose that differential EcR expression across forewing and hindwing eyespots at a critical stage of development explains the variation in levels of phenotypic plasticity across these serial homologues. This finding provides a novel signaling pathway, 20E, for the regulation of levels of phenotypic plasticity across body parts or serial homologs."

However, the actual dose-response relationship is still not known, mainly because of the fact that the linear non-threshold model of the relationship is not sufficient to capture the full dose-response relationship. We propose a novel model of the relationship that accounts for the known dose-response relationship between cell types and radiation exposure. We also propose two mechanisms that could account for the observed dose-response relationship. We use our model to test the effects of these mechanisms on cellular responses to low dose radiation. We find that the intracellular mechanism can account for the occurrence of dose-response relationships and that the communication mechanism can account for the observed dose-response relationship. The model, however, suggests that the communication mechanism is essential for the long term survival of cell populations that are continuously exposed to relatively low levels of radiation, which cannot be achieved with the intracellular mechanism."

These mutations were introduced into the Env protein as an experiment, and then placed into the viral genome. We found that mutations conferring CTL escape in the p24 region of Env were associated with reduced viral replication fitness, whereas mutations conferring CTL escape in the p24 region did not. One mutation conferred a significant decrease in viral replication fitness, whereas another conferred a decrease in replicative fitness.

The resulting population code is simple to describe the response of single neurons, and it does not depend on the stimulus frequency. In particular, it can be used to predict the response of populations of neurons to time differences between two other stimulus features, e. g., the difference between two sound sources.

We show that BAD-1 binds to heparin specifically and saturably, and that its activity is required for the effector functions of immune cells. We also show that the repeats of BAD-1 block activation of immune cells by a mechanism requiring the effector CD47. The repeats of BAD-1 and the mammalian ortholog of TSP-1 form tandem repeats, and their structure and mechanism of action are similar to those of the mammalian receptor.

This is the case in the case of the Argentine ant, which has evolved a sophisticated system to use the environment to guide its behavior. We have studied the formation of trail patterns by this insect. The experiments were done in an environment mimicking the natural conditions in the real world. We have found that the individual ant respond to local pheromone concentrations in a proportional way: the difference between the sum of the two sets of pheromone and the amount of pheromone on the two sides of the ant determines the magnitude of the turning angle.

Our results demonstrate that the CF1A complex regulates transcription by interacting with the transcription factors to bind to the promoter. Furthermore, the recruitment of general transcription factors onto the promoter is unaffected in the clp1 mutant, which suggests that CF1A complex influences the recruitment of the general transcription factors onto the promoter. Chromosome Conformation Capture ( 3C ) analysis revealed a physical interaction of the promoter and terminator regions of a gene in the presence of a functional CF1A complex.

We find that the amount of M. tb genetic diversity harbored by individuals with TB can vary dramatically, likely as a function of disease severity. Surprisingly, we do not find an appreciable impact of TB treatment on M. tb diversity. In examining genomic data from M. tb samples within and between hosts, we find that genes involved in the regulation, synthesis, and transport of immunomodulatory cell envelope lipids appear repeatedly in the extremes of various statistical measures of diversity. Many of these genes have been identified as possible targets of selection in other studies employing different methods and data sets. Taken together, these observations suggest that M. tb cell envelope lipids are targets of selection within hosts. Many of these lipids are specific to pathogenic mycobacteria and, in some cases, human-pathogenic mycobacteria. We speculate that rapid adaptation of cell envelope lipids is facilitated by functional redundancy, flexibility in their metabolism, and their roles mediating interactions with the host."

A key question in this process is the identification of these spliced peptides from the proteasome, the proteasome apparatus responsible for processing the cell\u2019s primary defense against pathogens. Until now, the identification of the proteasome-catalyzed peptide has been entirely dependent on the availability of a specific cell population, i. e. cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes. Here we describe a computational algorithm that has the potential to identify spliced peptides generated by the major cellular protease, the 20S proteasome, without the need for a specific cell population. Our algorithm is independent of the specific cell population and can be applied to a wide variety of substrate polypeptides. By applying our algorithm to the analysis of a panel of four different substrate polypeptides, derived from human tumor as well as viral antigens, we identified fifteen new spliced peptides generated by the 20S proteasome. These results suggest that 20S proteasomes represent a molecular machine that, due to its catalytic and structural properties, facilitates the generation of spliced peptides, thereby providing a pool of qualitatively new peptides from which functionally relevant products may be selected."

The parasite is a member of the phylum Entamoeba and Phylum B. Phagocytosis is the process of engulfing solid particles, such as bacteria, parasites and fungi, to form an internal phagocytic compartment. Phagocytosis is a highly regulated process, which is closely associated with host-pathogen interaction. Phagocytosis is the process of engulfing solid particles, and a unique feature of this process is the internalization of the particle by the endocytic pathway. The process of phagocytosis is regulated by several proteins. However, the role of these proteins in phagocytosis is still largely uncharacterized in protists. Here, we have studied the function of 14-3-3 protein 3 ( EhP3 ), which is known to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in several organisms. We found that this protein is present in the parasite phagocytosis process and that its downregulation results in extensive impairment of this process. Moreover, our results revealed that the dynamics of this protein may also be controlled by EhP3. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of phagocytosis in the protozoan parasite E. histolytica."

Here we show that the visual code in retinal waves optimizes for temporal slowness by employing a biologically plausible model of retinal waves. We show that the results obtained from the model match the visual code obtained by the retinal waves. The results also support the idea that retinal waves share relevant temporal and spatial properties with natural visual input. Hence, retinal waves seem suitable training stimuli to learn invariances and thereby shape the developing early visual system."

The most widely used antifungal, fluconazole ( FLC ), is associated with aneuploidy. However, 50% of isolates that are resistant to FLC, the most widely used antifungal, are aneuploid and some aneuploidies can also confer FLC resistance. We sought to determine if FLC exposure causes or only selects for aneuploidy. We analyzed diploid strains during exposure to FLC and found that the process of aneuploid formation in C. albicans is highly reminiscent of early stages in human tumorigenesis, and aneuploidy is required for the formation of aneuploid cells. We also found that the process of aneuploid formation in C. albicans is highly reminiscent of the formation of tetraploid cells in mice, in which the abnormal number of spindles results in unequal DNA segregation and viable aneuploid progeny. Finally, trimera formation was detected in response to other azole antifungal, in related Candida species, and in an in vivo model for Candida infection, suggesting that aneuploidy arises due to azole treatment of several pathogenic yeasts and that this can occur during the infection process."

These systems consist of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator that is recruited to a common promoter by a common signal peptide. Despite the high degree of sequence homology, these systems are able to exert their activity by two completely different mechanisms: inducing their response regulator to phosphorylate the sensor histidine kinase or blocking its response to the signal peptide. However, the regulatory mechanism involving the phosphoinositide receptor ( Phr ) has remained unknown at the molecular level. Using X-ray crystallography, we have determined the structure of the anti-activator of competence RR ComA, alone and in complex with its regulatory peptide PhrF. The structural and functional data presented herein reveal that peptide PhrF blocks the RapF-ComA interaction through an allosteric mechanism. PhrF accommodates in the C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain of RapF by inducing its constriction, a conformational change propagated by a pronounced rotation to the N-terminal ComA-binding domain. This movement partially disrupts the ComA binding site by triggering the ComA disassociation, whose interaction with RapF is also sterically impaired in the PhrF-induced conformation of RapF. Sequence analyses of the Rap proteins, guided by the RapF-PhrF structure, reveal the molecular basis of Phr recognition and discrimination, allowing us to relax the Phr specificity of RapF by a single residue change."

We found that increased level of GDNF in the central nervous system increases the number of adult dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the number of dopaminergic terminals in the dorsal striatum. At the functional level, GDNF levels increased striatal dopamine levels and augmented striatal dopamine release and re-uptake. Importantly, we report that adverse phenotypic effects associated with spatially unregulated GDNF applications were not observed. Further, we report how GDNF levels regulate kidney development and identify microRNAs miR-9, miR-96, miR-133, and miR-146a as negative regulators of GDNF expression via interaction with GDNF 3\u2019UTR in vitro.

This question is often addressed by examining the speciation process itself, which provides a better understanding of the process than studying how the species split. The simplest way to study the process of speciation is to consider the population structure of a species, in which each species is represented by a single clone. However, a population structure can be more complex, in which each species is represented by a set of clones. Here, we propose a model of bacterial evolution that accounts for the possibility of speciation within a recombining species. We show that the amount of habitat overlap between any two species determines the outcome of a pair of such speciation clusters, which may range from fast speciation with little interaction between the clusters to a stationary population structure, where different clusters maintain an equilibrium distance between each other for an indefinite time. We fit our model to two bacterial data sets. In S. pneumoniae, we find a genomeically and ecologically distinct subset, held at a relatively constant genetic distance from the majority of the population through frequent recombination with it, while in Campylobacter jejuni, we find a minority population we predict will continue to diverge at a higher rate."

Each epidemic was associated with a single transmission event, half of which triggered a local outbreak, while the other epidemics originated elsewhere. Gravity model estimates indicate a sharp decay in influenza transmission with the distance between infectious and susceptible cities, consistent with spread dominated by work commutes rather than air traffic.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of HF pathogenesis remain unclear. In this work, we address the functional significance of miR-29 in vivo and demonstrate that the absence of miR-29 triggers the up-regulation of its target, the master metabolic regulator PGC1\u03b1, which in turn generates profound alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to a pathological accumulation of small mitochondria in mutant animals that contribute to cardiac disease. Notably, we demonstrate that systemic hypertension and HFpEF can be rescued by PGC1\u03b1 haploinsufficiency, which reduces cardiac mitochondrial accumulation and extends lifespan of mutant mice. In addition, we show that PGC1\u03b1 is overexpressed in hearts from patients with HF. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the in vivo function of miR-29 in cardiovascular homeostasis."

We found evidence of acute viral respiratory infection in 142 healthy subjects and 63 subjects infected with influenza. The remaining subjects had a rhinovirus infection, other viral infections, or no viral agent identified. We analyzed the gene expression profile of 73 subjects with influenza and 24 subjects with other viral infections. The results show that influenza virus infection induced a dramatic upregulation of interferon pathway and innate immunity genes. This persisted for 2-4 days. The gene expression pattern was indistinguishable from baseline ( enrollment ) at the two seasons. The data show a recovery phase at days 4 and 6 with differentially expressed transcripts implicated in cell proliferation and repair. By day 21 the gene expression pattern was indistinguishable from baseline ( enrollment ). We also examined pre- and post-infection anti-influenza antibody titers defining novel gene expression correlates."

However, the ability to do this in a noisy environment is a fundamental challenge for all biological systems. Here, we developed a generalized time-frequency analysis framework to systematically explore the dynamical properties of biomolecular networks. We focused on two well-characterized yeast gene regulatory networks. These networks are comprised of two different basic architectures. We found that the two networks have different network behaviors in terms of trade-offs in responsiveness and noise suppression. The wild type galactose network is highly responsive while the oleate network has greater noise suppression ability. The LPS network appears more balanced, exhibiting less bias toward noise suppression or responsiveness. Exploration of the network parameter space exposed dramatic differences in system behaviors for each network. Our approach has the potential to reveal fundamental structural and dynamical principles that underlie each network, and to demonstrate the utility of the TFA approach for systems and synthetic biology."

Although CD and Kala-Aarring are of major importance to public health, the mechanisms by which these pathogens circumvent these responses are still poorly understood. Here, we use gene expression profiling to compare the macrophage activation programs elicited by these stimuli and the macrophage activation programs elicited by bacterial products. We found that macrophages exposed to T. cruzi ( the infecting agent of Chagas disease ) produce a transcriptional signature characteristic of the macrophage response to a Th1 cytokine, IFNG, and TNF. However, T. cruzi activates macrophages more closely than Th1 cytokines, and the macrophages infected by the kinetoplastid pathogens produce a transcriptional response that resembles the response of macrophages stimulated by the cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17. These results provide new insights into how macrophages respond to kinetoplastid pathogens and how these responses are linked to macrophage activation."

This process is initiated by the recognition of a common cell surface receptor on the surface of the cell ( the germ cell receptor, Gata4 ). Gata4 is expressed only in cells of the germ cell lineage, and germ cells are known to enter meiosis in response to gonad cues. Here we test the hypothesis that germ cell licensing is cell-autonomous by examining the fate of germ cells in the Gata4 conditional mutant mouse embryo. We find that germ cells retained characteristics of the cell type they had originated from, but they were unable to enter meiosis. Our results suggest that germ cell licensing is cell-autonomous by the somatic genital ridge.

While we did not find lip or palate defects in Grem1-deficient mice, wild type embryonic palatal shelves developed divergent shapes when cultured in the presence of ectopic Grem1 protein ( P = 0. 0014 ).

We have now identified the receptors and signaling pathways required for the induction of this response. We show that the OMV is internalized and killed by B cells, whereas the interaction with B cells is mediated by a series of trans-membrane receptors. In addition to the immune receptors, we also show that the OMV contains a motif that is critical for the B cell response. This motif is located on the outer membrane and is required for the interaction of the OMV with the adaptive immune system.

RV-C is a rodent-borne virus, like all other rhinoviruses, and unlike the human counterparts, which are rodent-borne viruses, RV-C does not bind human ICAM-1 or LDL receptors. The RV-C receptor is unique to airway epithelium, and it does not bind ICAM-1 or LDL receptors. The RV-C receptor is therefore unique to RV-A and RV-B. We sought to identify the requirements for the RV-C interaction with host cells. We mapped RV-C receptor binding sites, and discovered that RV-C binding requires a single amino acid residue in the N-terminal region of the receptor, the extracellular repeat domain 5 ( EC5 ). The EC5 is located at the interface between receptor-ligand interaction and receptor multimerization. Our results suggest that RV-C uses the same amino acid residue in the EC5 region, but that the receptor is a multimer with stabilizing calcium ions, rather than a monomer. These findings suggest that the RV-C interaction with host cells does not involve the interaction with an ICAM-1 receptor, and that other rhinoviruses use a similar mechanism."

Here, we show that the transcription factor Kr\u00fcppel-like factor-6 ( Klf6 ) is required for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, and that its action is mediated by a novel gp130-Klf importin axis. Klf6 is rapidly induced in oligodendrocyte progenitors by gp130 factors, and promotes differentiation. Conversely, in mice lacking Klf6, OLP undergoes maturation arrest and myelination defects. Our data demonstrate that the transcription factor Klf6 acts as a gp130-sensitive transactivator of the nuclear import factor importin-\u03b15 ( Imp\u03b15 ), and interfering with this mechanism interrupt step-wise differentiation. Underscoring the significance of this axis in vivo, mice with conditional inactivation of gp130 signaling display defective Klf6 and Imp\u03b15 expression, OLP maturation arrest and apoptosis, and failure of CNS myelination."

The Abo group is thought to have been the first group to have its core in liquid water, and the Biotic group was the last group to have its core in water, which provided its biological basis. Here, we present a computational model that demonstrates how this system can evolve into a system that is robust to a wide range of external perturbations. We show that this system typically can be stabilised by increasing the diversity of the organism and the number of environmental variables while the probability of the system being in an attractor that lies within prescribed boundaries decreases approximately linearly. This suggests that the system is able to reorganise itself into a new state. We argue that the microbial Abo group is the best case study for studying the emergence of environmental homeostasis, and that the reorganisation mechanism we have identified is a generic mechanism for biological feedback loops to reorganise into new states."

Our model reveals how different mechanical properties, including osmotic pressure, cell-cell adhesion and stiffness, influence the shape and size of the cell division plane. Mitotic area expansion is largely driven by regulation of cytoplasmic pressure. Surprisingly, mitotic shape roundness within physiological ranges is most sensitive to cell-cell adhesion and stiffness.

This rich dynamical activity may enable the network to transmit sensory information to a wide range of cortical neurons. In this study, we developed a network model of cortical activity and investigated how the simulated cortical network could encode sensory information. We found that the network generated activity patterns in agreement with the activity of the primary visual cortex.

The virus replicates inside the cell by a process called endosomal sorting complex ( ESCRT ), which is very important for the cell to get rid of damaged or infectious cellular components. To understand the function of the ESCRT in HBV replication and virion secretion, we have analyzed the function of ESCRT in HBV. We found that an ESCRT protein called HGS is important in both HBV replication and virion secretion. HGS is involved in the recruitment of other cellular proteins to the ESCRT and in the production of mature viral particles. We also found that HGS is required for the production of HBV virions in the liver, but not in the virion. Surprisingly, HGS can also affect the production of naked capsids, a kind of viral protein that is known to be involved in the release of HBV virions.

We report that brain-derived neural stem ( NS ) cells acquire undifferentiated morphology rapidly and at high frequency after a single round of transduction with reprogramming factors. However, critical attributes of true pluripotency, such as stable expression of endogenous Oct4 and Nanog, and ability to colonise chimaeras\u2014were not attained. We applied molecularly defined conditions for the derivation and propagation of authentic pluripotent stem cells from embryos. We combined dual inhibition ( 2i ) of mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling and glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( GSK3 ) with the self-renewal cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ). The 2i/LIF condition induced stable up-regulation of Oct4 and Nanog, reactivation of the X chromosome, transgene silencing, and competence for somatic and germline chimaerism. Using 2i/LIF, NS cell reprogramming required only 1\u20132 integrations of each transgene. Furthermore, transduction with Sox2 and c-Myc is dispensable, and Oct4 and Klf4 are sufficient to convert NS cells into chimaera-forming iPS cells. These findings demonstrate that somatic cell state influences requirements for reprogramming and delineate two phases in the process.

Fitting a network model to these quantities as measured in sexual behavior surveys is expected to result in a good representation of Chlamydia trachomatis transmission in terms of the heterogeneity of the distribution of infection in the population.

We find that a high level of heterogeneity in the ability of individuals to acquire and maintain ( additional ) partners strongly facilitates the ability of the network model to accurately simulate the power-law distribution of the lifetime number of contacts, and the age at which these partnerships were accumulated, as surveyed in actual sexual contact networks. Furthermore, we also find that epidemiological measures on disease prevalence in survey data can be used as a powerful tool for building accurate sexual contact networks, as these measures provide information on the level of mixing between individuals of different levels of sexual activity in the population, a parameter that is hard to acquire through surveying individuals."

In E. coli, the phosphotransferase system ( PTS ) is involved in the uptake of sugar molecules, and its activity has been shown to be tightly coupled to other cellular pathways. However, it remains unclear whether and how the PTS network is actually integrated into the cell and how it performs its function. Here, we used F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer to investigate the network properties of the PTS network in E. coli. Our results demonstrate that despite the seemingly complex cellular network, its core component works in a surprisingly simple way, sensing the overall influx of PTS sugars irrespective of the sugar identity and distributing this information equally through all studied branches of the network. Moreover, it also integrates several specific metabolic inputs. Our results also suggest that the uninduced PTS network is well suited for the quality of the carbon source, apparently representing an optimal regulatory strategy."

This pattern of increased resistance has been observed in the laboratory bacterium E. coli, and is termed a phenomenon known as \u201c increases in resistance frequency\u201d. In this paper we show that increases in resistance frequency do not appear to be the result of an increase in mutation rate, but rather are likely due to an increase in the frequency of certain antibiotic resistant mutations. We use whole genome sequencing to show that some rifampicin resistant mutants are more frequent in aging compared to young colonies of E. coli. We then use a combination of mathematical and empirical approaches to show that, in contrast to commonly held belief, there are no evidence that bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics are better able to spread in aging compared to young, free-living colonies. Our results show that the frequency of antibiotic resistant mutants does not appear to be an important factor in explaining the increase in resistance frequency as a result of exposure to growth-limiting conditions."

In rational drug design, the flexibility of a protein's structure and binding site can be analyzed using structures with and without bound ligands. To do this, one must compare the structure of the protein's bound ligand with its unbound bound ligand. The structural analysis is often done in combination with crystallography, which is a powerful technique for determining the structure of proteins in their bound state. The results of such an analysis can be interpreted as a map of how the protein changes its structure and how its binding site changes. Here we present a computational framework for analyzing the structural analysis of proteins bound with ligands of different sizes. We use this framework to compare the structural analysis of the bound and unbound states of the same protein, and compare them to the unbound state. We show that, for the bound state, the structural analysis is compatible with the common practice in rational drug design where backbones are kept rigid and side chains are allowed to flexibility."

Here we show that the SrbA and SCAAT binding proteins are involved in the metabolism of ergosterol, a major fungal lipid. We also show that the cyp51A mutant is significantly attenuated for the ability to grow in the presence of a variety of other azole drugs. Finally, we demonstrate that the cyp51A mutant is highly tolerant to the azoles, allylamines ( terbina Fine ) and Statins ( simvastatin ).

Here we estimate the number of spacers in a CRISPR array of a prokaryotic cell which maximizes its protection against a viral attack. The optimality follows from a competition between two trends: too few distinct spacers make host vulnerable to an attack by a virus with mutated corresponding protospacers, while an excessive variety of spacers dilutes the number of the CRISPR complexes armed with the most recent and thus most useful spacers. We find that depending on such parameters, the rate of viral mutation, and the number of viral species, the predicted optimal number of spacers lies within a range that agrees with experimentally-observed values."

In sexually dimorphic animals, the germline is able to differentiate into both male and female gametes and to produce sperm, an essential reproductive organ. The male gamete is formed by a specialized cell called the germline stem cell ( GSC ) that is able to generate sperm. The sex-determining role of the GSC is to prevent premature differentiation of the germline stem cell ( GSC ) to the male gamete. The mechanism by which the GSC controls sex determination is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the transcription factor Chinmo, which is expressed in the GSC, controls sex determination by regulating the expression of the sex-determining gene Sex-lethal ( Sxl ). We find that in the absence of Chinmo, Sxl expression is reduced and the production of sex-determining sperm is compromised. Surprisingly, the effects of Chinmo in the female somatic gonad do not depend on Sxl but instead requires the presence of the female lethal ( 2 ) d gene, which is also important for sex determination. Our work reveals a novel Sxl-independent mechanism of sex determination in Drosophila and has implications for the understanding of male germ cell development and the control of the sex determination hierarchy."

Here, we investigated the PPi release process in a single-subunit RNA polymerase ( T7 ) from bacteriophage T7. We constructed a jump-transfer-cavity kinetic model for the PPi release. We found that the PPi release in T7 RNAP is initiated by two catalytic aspartic acids, followed by a comparatively slow jump-transfer from-cavity activation process. Combining with microsecond long MD simulations, we also found that the activation is hindered by charged residue associations as well as by local steric and hydrogen bond interactions. By analyzing the microsecond MD simulations, we also found that the PPi release is not tightly coupled to opening motions of an O-helix on the fingers domain of T7 RNAP according to the microsecond MD simulations. Our study thus supports the Brownian ratchet scenario of the mechano-chemical coupling in the transcription elongation of the single-subunit polymerase."

These sequences are typically studied as \u2018data sets\u2019, in which each data set is used to represent all possible pairs of transcription factors in the data. However, the problem of \u2018 missing data\u2019 has been that, until now, the data sets have been largely considered independent, without any loss of essential features. However, in practice, data sets can be more important, and the false negative rate of finding false negative factors has recently increased.

We show that this motif can outperform previously proposed methods, and also suggest that it outperforms previously proposed methods on a large number of data sets."

Previous studies have shown that the complement system provides protection during the influenza A virus infection, however, the role of individual complement pathways is not yet clear. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, we show that the complement system is necessary for efficient protection against the pandemic influenza A virus infection. Our results show that the complement system not only provides direct neutralization of the pandemic influenza A virus, but also leads to the optimum generation of protective immune responses."

In most vertebrates, a single PAX6 gene encodes a transcription factor required for eye, brain, olfactory system, and pancreas development. In zebrafish, following a whole-genome duplication event in an ancestral teleost, duplicates pax6a and pax6b jointly fulfill these roles. The molecular mechanism for this process remains elusive. Here, we show that, in zebrafish, loss of pax6a and pax6b results in loss of the co-orthologous target binding site, which is associated with loss of the normal PAX6 expression pattern. This highlights the functional conservation of pax6 downstream ( 3\u2032 ) control sequences, which in most vertebrates reside within the introns of a ubiquitously expressed neighbour gene, ELP4. We show that subfunctionalization of pax6 is mediated by the evolution of specific cis-regulatory elements, correlating strongly with the diverged expression of co-orthologues. Our data suggest that, in zebrafish, the co-orthologous target binding site is lost by subfunctionalization."

This was dependent on the NADPH oxidase enzyme, which was also required for infection. Inflammasome activation was not increased by exogenous infection or by chlamydial metabolite, a metabolite previously shown to be important for the activation of inflammasomes. This work reveals that this important bacterial metabolite is a key factor initiating inflammasome activation through the host innate immune system.

We found that the partners' investments in a widespread ant\u2013plant symbiosis increase with water stress across 26 sites along a Mesoamerican precipitation gradient. At lower precipitation levels, Cordia alliodora trees invest more carbon in Azteca ants via phloem-feeding scale insects that provide the ants with sugars, and the ants provide better defense of the carbon-producing leaves. Under water stress, the trees have smaller carbon pools. A model of the carbon trade-offs for the mutualistic partners shows that the observed strategies can arise from the carbon costs of rare but extreme events of herbivory in the rainy season. Thus, water limitation, together with the risk of herbivory, increases the strength of a carbon-based mutualism."

SAG neuroblasts originate in the floor of the otic vesicle, a structure that contains neurogenic precursors. New neuroblasts soon delaminate and migrate towards the hindbrain where they eventually stop dividing and differentiate. Regulation of these events is only partially understood. Here we show that a gene, Tfap2a, is required to control the expression of two important signaling pathways, Fgf and Notch. Blocking Tfap2a elevates both Fgf and Notch signaling, thereby slowing maturation of SAG neurons. However, direct blocking of both pathways mimics all observed effects of Tfap2a overexpression, including neuronal death. Thus, Tfap2a acts through the Bmp7a pathway to control the duration, amount and speed of SAG neural development. This work uncovers a new pathway that regulates the activity of the Bmp7a pathway, which in turn modulates the activity of Fgf."

The role of the MEK/ERK pathway is critical for both viral replication and for the development of KS and MCD. In this study, we show that the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway is essential for lytic viral gene expression and virion production. We also show that the transcriptional activator pERK2 promotes nuclear accumulation of the MEK/ERK pathway activator pERK2, which is in turn required for the activation of downstream targets. We also show that the cytoplasmic pools of pERK2 show no co-localization with either RSK or R45 but activation of pERK downstream targets is evident throughout infection. Together, these observations suggest a model in which R45 interacts with pERK2 to promote its nuclear accumulation, thereby promoting lytic viral gene expression while also preserving persistent and robust activation of both nuclear and cytoplasmic ERK targets."

However, these two nuclear RNA degradation pathways play distinct roles in the regulation of BDF2 expression, as we show that the RMD and SMD pathways of the BDF2 mRNA are differentially activated or repressed in specific environmental conditions. RMD is hyper-activated by salt stress and repressed by hydroxyurea-induced DNA damage while SMD is inactivated by salt stress and predominates during DNA damage. Mutations of cis-acting signals that control SMD and RMD rescue numerous growth defects of cells lacking Bdf1p, and show that SMD plays an important role in the DNA damage response.

However, these models are typically too simple to capture the behavior of a cell on a heterogeneous substrate, or are too slow to simulate entire cell populations. In this paper, we develop a hybrid model of the Escherichia coli chemotaxis system that combines the properties of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux signal processing pathway and the adaptation dynamics described by ordinary differential equations. Our model dramatically reduces computational costs and allows the highly efficient simulation of E. coli chemotaxis. We use the model to investigate chemotaxis in different gradients, and suggest a new, constant-activity type of gradient to systematically study chemotactic behavior of virtual bacteria. We show that optimal chemotaxis is observed in a narrow range of CheA kinase activity, where concentration of the response regulator CheY-P falls into the operating range of flagellar motors. Our results suggest that in liquid media the variability in adaptation times among cells may be evolutionary favorable to ensure coexistence of subpopulations that will be optimally tactic in different gradients. However, in a porous medium, variability appears to be less important, because agar structure poses mainly negative selection against subpopulations with low levels of adaptation enzymes.

It has been known for over a century that biological networks are symmetrical, and that the shape of the network changes with body size. Biological allometries, such as metabolic scaling, have been hypothesized to result from selection to maximize how vascular networks fill space yet resistances. The WBE model postulates that this principle ( space-filling and energy minimization ) is general, and can be used to predict how the resulting geometry of biological networks then governs their allometric scaling. Perhaps the most central biological allometry is how metabolic rate scales with body size. A core assumption of the WBE model is that networks are symmetric with respect to their geometric properties. However, biological networks are rarely if ever symmetric. An open question is: does incorporating asymmetric branching change or influence the predictions of the WBE model? We derive a general network model that relaxes the symmetric assumption and show that asymmetry can still be incorporated in the many allometric scaling relationships via total network volume. Most importantly, we show that the 3/4 metabolic scaling exponent from Kleiber\u2019s Law can still be attained within many asymmetric networks."

Here we study the emergence of functionally specific connectivity in large-scale networks with plasticity rules, as a result of the recurrent network dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the emergence of specific connectivity in large-scale recurrent networks can be obtained by appropriate rules of synaptic plasticity. If these conditions are met, the initial orientation selectivity guides the process of Hebbian learning and, as a result, functionally specific and a surplus of bidirectional connections emerge. Our results thus demonstrate the importance of inhibition as a critical element in the emergence of functional specificity in large-scale functional networks, highlight the role of inhibition as a critical element in this process, and paves the way for further computational studies of sensory processing in neuronal network models."

The use of animal models has allowed identification of bacterial factors that influence the immune response to bacterial infection. We have used a mouse model of bacterial infection to identify a bacterial factor that influences the immune response to a bacterial infection. The immunodominant bacterial factor that influenced the immune response to bacterial infection was found to be the production of a single cytokine, IL-6. The immune response to bacterial infection depended on IL-6 production and intranasal inoculation, which resulted in the generation of IL-17A, IL-17A, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17B. This response was dependent on the innate cytokine IL-6. Mice lacking IL-6, which was also the most important immunodominant antigen-specific CD4+ helper T cells, were not protected from infection.

We design our approach to be easily applicable to different organisms and enzymes.

We sample and cluster the free energy landscape using Markov State Models ( MSM ) with major and minor exchange states with high correlation with the NMR relaxation data and low NOE violation.

We show here that the ubiquitous transcription factor Upfront Stimulatory Factor 1 ( USF1 ), which is known to promote apoptosis and to be essential for tumor suppression, functions as a tumor suppressor in the context of DNA damage. We show that loss of USF1 causes an increase in the p53 protein and an arrest in the cell cycle. Consistently, we demonstrate that p53 can be restored by the expression of full-length USF1. This is the first study to show that the p53 pathway is altered in cells lacking USF1, and we present the first evidence that the loss of USF1 is a cause for p53 instability. Our results provide new insight into how loss of p53 function can occur in any cell type. Furthermore, these findings are of clinical relevance because they provide new therapeutic prospects in stabilizing and reactivating the p53 pathway."

How this coordination precisely works is unknown. Previously, we reported that the ANXUR receptor-like kinases ( RLKs ) of the CrRLK1L subfamily in Arabidopsis are essential to sustain growth without loss of cell wall integrity in Arabidopsis. In this study, we show that over-expression of the ANXUR RLKs inhibits growth by over-activating exocytosis and the over-accumulation of secreted cell wall material. Moreover, the characterization of mutations in two partially redundant pollen-expressed NADPH oxidases coupled with genetic interaction studies demonstrate that the ANXUR RLKs function upstream of these NADPH oxidases. Using the H2O2-sensitive HyPer and the Ca2+-sensitive YC3. 60 sensors in NADPH oxidase-deficient mutants, we reveal that NADPH oxidases generate tip-localized, pulsating H2O2 production that functions, possibly through Ca2+ channel activation, to maintain a steady tip-focused Ca2+ gradient during growth. Our findings support a model where ECM-sensing receptors regulate reactive oxygen species production, Ca2+ homeostasis, and exocytosis to coordinate ECM-performance with the internal growth machinery."

The mosquito, which is the vector, cannot synthesise most of the signalling molecules needed to trigger gametogenesis, so the mechanism of this process has been elusive. Here we show that a mosquito-derived molecule, xanthurenic acid ( XA ), can trigger gametogenesis in the absence of a mammalian homologue of the human cGMP kinase, a key factor in the activation of the signalling pathway. We have also identified an inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKG ), which is required for XA-induced gametogenesis.

Accurate estimation of the spatial distribution of the disease is required for public health decision-makers to plan appropriate control strategies. Current methods of estimating the spatial distribution of infectious disease are often restricted to small-scale spatial aggregation. However, these spatial aggregation methods are often inaccurate when extrapolating to large-scale spatial aggregation.

One of the genes, Amr1, was previously shown to be involved in the production of melanin, a pigment that is a major component of the plant cell wall. We found that mutants of Amr1 also caused lesions with a two-fold larger diameter than the wild type. This phenotype was confirmed by genetic analyses. Unexpectedly, mutants of the third gene, Amr1, caused lesions with a two-fold larger diameter than the wild type. We created mutants of the \u0394amr1 gene and characterized their phenotypes. We found that the \u0394amr1 mutants used pectin as a carbon source more efficiently than the wild type. We also found that the Amr1 protein was localized in the nuclei of hyphae and in highly melanized conidia during the late stage of plant pathogenesis. RNA-seq analysis revealed that three genes, along with the deleted Amr1 gene, were expressed at low levels in the mutants. The results of this study suggested that a gene important for survival in nature negatively affected virulence, probably by a less efficient use of plant cell-wall materials. We speculate that the functions of the Amr1 gene are important to the success of A. brassicicola as a competitive saprophyte and plant parasite."

We show that, in the primary visual cortex of the cat and the monkey, spontaneous cortical activity displays scale-invariant scale-invariant features. We also show that these scale-invariant features are dependent on collective synchrony among neurons, LFP fluctuations, and behavioral state. Our results support the idea that criticality in cortical dynamics is not stationary, but fluctuates during the sleep-wake cycle and between different vigilance states."

We have identified spe-44, a protein that is conserved in all Caenorhabditis species, as an important regulator of sperm gene expression. We show that spe-44 is required for the expression of hundreds of genes in the sperm, which are then regulated by the germline sex determination pathway. spe-44 is only required in the sperm and is not expressed in the germline or X chromosome. We also show that spe-44 is required for the expression of genes that are expressed in the Y chromosome, which is also required for sperm gene expression. Our results demonstrate that spe-44 is a novel regulator of sperm gene expression, and thus provide a novel mechanism by which the germline controls gamete gene expression."

Here, we applied a reverse-pathway genetic approach, combining knowledge of a biological pathway in order to identify a contribution of epistasis to ASDs in humans. We identified that genetic variation in the Ras/MAPK pathway contributes to ASD symptoms by increasing the expression level of a gene, GPR141, in a neuronal cell line. Further, we showed that genetic variation in the Ras/MAPK pathway also contributes to ASD symptoms in affected individuals. Finally, we used quantitative measures of ASD symptoms in a RASopathy-affected individual to demonstrate that GPR141 is dysregulated in a RASopathy neural cell line.

The production of new virus particles requires the activity of enzymes that break down glucose to produce malonyl-CoA, a fatty acid precursor. We have found that there are multiple enzymes that are involved in this process. Our results reveal that these enzymes are required for the production of very long chain fatty acids, which are required for the production of new virus particles.

Because ubiquitination is one of the most versatile of cellular signals, these distinct functions of E3 ligases suggested diverse ubiquitination pathways during surveillance for stalled translation. In this study, we report experimental evidences for a unique role of non-proteasomal K63 polyubiquitination during quality control for stalled translation. Inhibiting K63 polyubiquitination markedly abolished the quality control responses for stalled translation. More detailed analyses indicated that the effects of K63R mutations were independent of the proteasome and that K63 polyubiquitination is dependent on Hel2, one of the E3 ligases. Moreover, a K63R ubiquitin mutant barely inhibited the quality control pathway for nonstop translation, indicating distinct mechanisms for these highly related quality control pathways.

The hypothesis is supported by the observed pattern of clones induced at various stages of development and by analysis of polarity markers, which show a divergent pattern. We also show that JAGGED ( JAG ) is a key factor in promoting distal enhancement of growth rates and influences the extent of the divergent polarity field. Furthermore, we reveal links between the polarity field and auxin function: auxin-responsive markers such as DR5 have a broader distribution along the distal petal margin, consistent with the broad distal polarity field, and PETAL LOSS, which has been implicated in the control of auxin dynamics during petal initiation, is directly repressed by JAG.

Nine months later, 12 of the same subjects trained both legs in a second training period. RNA sequencing analysis of all 119 skeletal muscle biopsies showed that training altered the expression of 3, 404 gene isoforms, mainly associated with oxidative ATP production. Fifty-four genes had isoforms that changed in opposite directions. training altered expression of 34 novel transcripts, all with protein-coding potential. After nine months of detraining, no training-induced transcriptome differences were detected between the previously trained and untrained legs. Although there were several differences in the physiological and transcriptional responses to repeated training, no coherent evidence of an endurance training-induced transcriptional skeletal muscle memory was found. This human lifestyle intervention induced differential expression of thousands of isoforms and several transcripts from unannotated regions of the genome. It is likely that the observed isoform expression changes reflect adaptational mechanisms and processes that provide the functional and health benefits of regular physical activity."

An example of this class of proteins is the SOX SOX, which targets cellular mRNAs through cleavage of the mRNA. While it is known that cleavage occurs at specific locations defined by the sequence of the target mRNA, the mechanism of cleavage is not known. In this study, we address this paradox by using high-throughput sequencing of cleavage intermediates combined with a custom bioinformatics-based analysis pipeline to identify SOX cleavage sites across the mRNA transcriptome. We find that while cleavage sites are specific and reproducible, they are defined by a degenerate sequence motif containing a small number of conserved residues rather than a strong consensus sequence. This degenerate element is well represented in both human and KSHV mRNA, and its presence correlates with RNA destabilization by SOX. This represents a new endonuclease targeting strategy, in which use of a degenerate targeting element enables RNA cleavage at specific locations without restricting the range of targets. Furthermore, it shows that strong target selectivity can be achieved without a high degree of sequence specificity."

Here we expressed E1E2 heterodimer with an Fc-tag and a de novo designed heterodimeric tag and were able to isolate soluble E1E2 heterodimer suitable for functional and structural studies. Then, we performed structural and biochemical analyses of the E1E2 heterodimer and provided evidence for interactions between E1 and E2. Moreover, the E1E2 heterodimer is applied to examine the interactions with the known HCV receptors, neutralizing antibodies as well as the inhibition of HCV infection, confirming the functionality of the E1E2 heterodimer and the binding profiles of E1E2 with the cellular receptors. Therefore, the E1E2 heterodimer would be a valuable target for both viral studies and vaccination against HCV."

Elucidation of these mechanisms has been a major challenge in the past, and recent analysis of gene expression profiling suggests that many genes encode other regulators. Here, we investigated the role of the AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ), a conserved family of transcription factors that control many physiological functions in animals. We discovered that AMPK directly activates expression of aakg-4, a key AMP-binding isoform, encoding both putative AMP-binding regulatory subunits. We also show that this activation is required for the activation of AMPK target genes. This work demonstrates that AMPK regulates a family of genes in addition to AMP-binding subunits and suggests a positive feedback loop that accelerates AMPK-induced target gene expression. We also demonstrate that AMPK activates the AMPK \u03b2 subunit, aakb-1, but not the AAKG-4 isoform. Our findings suggest that AMPK and AMPB1 may have evolved to be co-regulated in a positive feedback loop. The AMPK \u03b2 subunit may also have been up-regulated in mammals, possibly to compensate for reduced AMPK activity. Our data suggest that AMPK may be a conserved target for metabolic control in animals."

Identifying cellular genes essential for virus replication is a powerful tool for understanding how the virus causes disease. The most widely used approach to discover new targets of antiviral drugs is to generate cells in which we randomly mutated ( trap ) genes in the genome and then discover genes that are essential for the replication of a given virus. However, this approach is not generally applicable to the discovery of cellular genes required for viral replication. Here, we take a different approach to identify cellular genes required for the replication of a panel of ten different viruses. We discovered 712 genes that are essential for the replication of 10 distinct cytotoxic mammalian viruses, 1 gram-negative bacterium, and 5 toxins. These genes, characterizing distinct topological network and evolutionary signatures, and occupying central hubs in the human interactome, are critical for the replication of the majority of viruses, and are frequently associated with Mendelian and orphan diseases, or somatic mutations in cancer. We also identified 110 putative druggable antiviral targets and prioritized several existing drugs ( e. g. Jacob's yeast inhibitor ) that may be potential for antiviral indication ( e. g. anti-Ebola ). In summary, this work provides a powerful methodology with a tight integration of gene-trap insertional mutagenesis testing and systems biology to identify new antiviral targets and drugs for the development of broadly acting and targeted clinical antiviral therapies."

Upon infection, EPEC, EHEC and C. rodentium inject a diverse set of proteins called effectors into the host cells where they interfere with host cell signaling pathways that are critical for host defense. One such protein, NleC, has recently been shown to be a metalloprotease that cleaves the NF-\u03baB Rel subunit, an important host factor that orchestrates both innate and adaptive immune responses for host defense. However, it remains unclear how NleC recognizes NF-\u03baB Rel subunits and how the NleC-mediated cleavage impacts on host immune responses in infected cells and animals. Here, we show that NleC specifically targets p65/RelA through an interaction with a unique N-terminal sequence in p65. This cleavage generates the p65/RelA fragment during C. rodentium infection in cultured cells. Moreover, the NleC-mediated p65 cleavage substantially affects the expression of a subset of NF-\u03baB target genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, immune cell infiltration in the colon, and tissue injury in C. rodentium-infected mice. Mechanistically, the NleC cleavage-generated p65 and ribosomal protein S3 ( RPS3 ), a \u2018 smoother\u2019 subunit of NF-\u03baB, interferes with the interaction between p65 and ribosomal protein S3, a \u2018 smoother\u2019 subunit of NF-\u03baB that is responsible for regulating the transcription of a subset of NF-\u03baB target genes. Thus, our results reveal a novel mechanism for A/E pathogens to specifically block NF-\u03baB signaling and inflammatory responses by cleaving a small percentage of p65 and targeting the p65/RPS3 interaction in host cells, thus providing novel insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of foodborne diseases."

During the imposed \u201cremodeling\u201d of gene expression, changes in the levels of particular mRNAs do not necessarily correlate with those of the encoded proteins, which could in part rely on the differential recruitment of mRNAs to translating ribosomes. To systematically address this issue, we have established an approach to rapidly access the translational status of each mRNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by affinity purification of endogenously formed ribosomes and the analysis of associated mRNAs with DNA microarrays. Using this method, we compared changes in total mRNA levels ( transcriptome ) with ribosome associations ( translatome ) after the application of different conditions of cellular stress. We show that severe stresses, induced by amino acid depletion or osmotic shock, stimulated highly correlated responses, including the majority of the translatome, but also the translatome. Among these putative translationally regulated messages, most components of the mitochondrial ATPase were most significantly altered upon treatment, consistent with the importance of regulation of this macromolecular complex. Our results suggest the presence of highly sensitive translational regulatory networks that coordinate functionally related messages.

Moreover, we show that bacterial envelope components, which are known to influence reovirus stability and entry into host cells, do not affect reovirus utilization of its cellular receptor.

Each cell is characterized by a preferred stimulus, a unique value of the external stimulus for which it responds fastest. The tWTA estimate for the stimulus is the preferred stimulus of the cell that fired the first spike in the entire population. We find that tWTA sensitivity to the stimulus grows algebraically fast with the number of cells in the population, N, in contrast to the logarithmic slow scaling of the conventional rate-WTA sensitivity with N. Noise correlations in first-spike times of different cells can limit the accuracy of the tWTA readout, even in the limit of large N, similar to the effect that has been observed in population coding theory.

The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling protein ATRX is a tumor suppressor in sarcomas, gliomas and other malignancies. ATRX loss of function promotes the alternative lengthening of telomeres ( ALT ) pathway in tumor cells, while it also affects Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) silencing of its target genes. Here, we take advantage of a zebrafish model to further define the role of inactivating ATRX mutations in carcinogenesis. We show that complete inactivation of atrx in zebrafish results in a dramatic reduction in the expression of alpha-globin, a key mediator of telomere maintenance. In atrx+/- fish, the expression of the p53 gene is reduced, but these fish develop various tumors that are not observed in their siblings. Our data indicate that the inactivation of ATRX loss of function in zebrafish results in a dramatic reduction in the expression of telomerase, a key component of the telomere maintenance machinery. Loss of telomerase function in atrx+/- fish results in a dramatic reduction in the expression of PRC2, a key component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2, which is implicated in silencing of its target genes."

The molecular and cellular mechanisms remained largely unknown.

Moreover, locomotor activity recordings revealed that p38 is essential for a wild-type timing of evening activity and for maintaining \u223c24 h behavioral rhythms. In addition, nuclear translocation of the clock protein Period was significantly delayed on the expression of a dominant-negative form of p38b in Drosophila's most important clock neurons.

To explore the contribution of alveolar macrophages ( Armstrongylococcus fascicularis ) in regulating the severity of IAV infection we generated a mouse model in which the IAV core binding gene was conditionally disrupted in myeloid cells. These mice exhibited a selective deficiency in alveolar macrophages ( PfM ). Following IAV infection these animals developed severe diffuse alveolar injury, lethal respiratory compromise, and consequent lethality. Lethal injury in these mice resulted from increased infection of Type-1 Alveolar Epithelial Cells ( T1AECs ) and the subsequent elimination of the infected T1AECs by the adaptive immune T cell response. Furthermore, we found that suppression of the cysLT pathway genes in T1AECs in vivo reduced their susceptibility to IAV infection, suggesting that they may utilize a previously unappreciated mechanism to protect T1AECs against IAV infection. Finally, blockade of the cysteinyl leukotriene ( cysLT ) pathway enzymes in T1AECs reduced the susceptibility of these T1AECs to IAV infection and protected these mice from lethal infection. These results suggest that Armstrongylococcus fascicularis may utilize a previously unappreciated mechanism to protect T1AECs against IAV infection, and thereby reduce the severity of IAV infection."

Here, we demonstrate that the E6 and E7 proteins activate the ATM DNA damage response in differentiating cells, as indicated by phosphorylation of CHK2, BRCA1 and NBS1. This activation is necessary for viral genome amplification, and also for formation of viral replication foci. In contrast, inhibition of ATM kinase activity in undifferentiated keratinocytes had no effect on the stable maintenance of viral genomes.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the mechanisms involved in the nociception triggered by the venom of PNV. We investigated the mechanisms involved in nociception induced by the venom of PNV. Our results show that PNV-induced nociception is not dependent on glutamate or histamine receptors or on mast cell degranulation, but it is mediated by the stimulation of serotonin 4 ( 5-HT4 ) and vanilloid receptors ( TRPV1 ). We also found that PNV-induced nociception was also reduced by the blockade of tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channels, acid-sensitive ion channels ( ASIC ) and TRPV1 receptors. Results suggest that both low- and high-molecular-weight toxins of PNV produce spontaneous nociception through direct or indirect action of kinin B2, TRPV1, 5-HT4 or ASIC receptors and voltage-dependent sodium channels present in sensory neurons but not in mast cells. Understanding the mechanisms involved in nociception induced by PNV are of interest not only for better treating poisoning by P. nigriventer but also appreciating the diversity of targets triggered by PNV toxins."

In both humans and mice, the spleen is a crucial organ involved in blood stage malaria clearance, while organ-specific disease appears to be associated with sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in vascular beds and subsequent recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes. Here we investigated the effect of IP-10 blockade in the development of experimental cerebral malaria and the induction of splenic anti-parasite immunity. We found that specific neutralization of IP-10 over the course of infection and genetic deletion of this chemokine in knockout mice reduces cerebral intravascular inflammation and is sufficient to protect P. berghei ANKA-infected mice from fatality. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that lack of IP-10 during infection significantly reduces parasitemia. The increased resistance to infection was associated with retention and subsequent expansion of parasite-specific T cells in spleens of infected animals, which appears to be advantageous for the control of parasite burden.

One strategy involves the production of a protein called pilin, which is a highly variable protein that is expressed on the surface of the bacteria, and can serve as a target of the immune system. Previously, we identified a small non-coding RNA ( sRNA ) promoter within the N. gonorrhoeae pilin locus ( pilE ) that is required for homologous recombination with the target of immune surveillance. In this work, we demonstrate that the sRNA is required for pilin Av. sRNA is a non-coding RNA that is transcribed into messenger RNA and then undergoes an RNA processing reaction resulting in the production of a large variety of sRNA transcripts. We show that sRNA is required for the initiation of programmed recombination events in N. gonorrhoeae, and the mechanism of sRNA action is distinct from the previously described guanine quartet ( G4 ) structure. Our findings provide a new molecular mechanism for the initiation of programmed recombination events in N. gonorrhoeae."

We show here that both short interfering RNAs and murine p53 activation are necessary and sufficient to mediate the effect of gene knockout animals. Both treatments inhibit p53 activity, and we identify p53 as the major target in both cases. Both of these functions are mediated through p53 activation, and neither loss of function nor p53 knockdown can compensate for loss of function of other genes. We also find that p53 activation is required for both short interfering RNAs and murine p53. We show that both of these effects are due to the activation of p53, and we find that p53 activation is also required for both short interfering RNAs. Together, these results show that p53 activation is a very important component of gene knockout animal behavior."

Here, we sequenced the genomes of one strain of S. sclerotiorum and two strains of B. cinerea. The comparative analysis of these genomes relative to each other and to other fungal genomes is provided here. We have mapped the S. sclerotiorum assembly to 16 chromosomes and found large-scale co-linearity with the B. cinerea genomes. We have mapped the S. sclerotiorum genome to 16 chromosomes and found that 13% of the genome shares transposable elements between S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea. We have also mapped the secondary metabolism genes of S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea and found that the genome of S. sclerotiorum differs from that of B. cinerea in many aspects. We also have analyzed the mating system of S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea and found evidence for the evolution of heterothallism from homothallism. Our data shed light on the evolutionary and mechanistic bases of the genetically complex traits of necrotrophic pathogenicity and sexual mating.

It is an important public health problem in the tropics, and has recently emerged in all continents except Antarctica. DENV is naturally transmitted by mosquitoes to humans. It usually does not cause severe disease in mosquitoes, but it can infect cells of both humans and mosquitoes. The latter are thought to be the site of initial DENV infection. It is thus interesting to know how the virus spreads among cells in tissues such as the midgut within live mosquitoes. Here, we demonstrate that cell-to-cell spreading is one way for DENV to infect neighboring cells without depending on the mode of release and entry. In the meantime, a membrane-bound vesicle containing tetraspanin C189 was formed in response to DENV infection in the C6/36 cell and was subsequently transported along with the contained virus. Knockdown of C189 in DENV-infected cells is shown herein to reduce cell-to-cell transmission of the virus, which may be recovered by co-transfection with a C189-expressing vector in DENV-infected cells. Moreover, cell-to-cell transmission usually occurs at the site where the donor cell directly contacts the recipient cell. Our results provide evidence that C189 is involved in the intercellular spread of progeny viral particles between mosquito cells."

Most of the existing literature on mollusks is descriptive. The mathematical understanding of the underlying coupling between pre-existing shell morphology, de novo surface deposition and morpho-elastic volume growth is at a nascent stage, primarily limited to reduced geometric representations. Here, we propose a general, three-dimensional computational framework coupling pre-existing morphology, incremental surface growth by accretion, and morpho-elastic volume growth. We exercise this framework by applying it to explain the stepwise morphogenesis of seashells during growth: new material surfaces are laid down by accretive growth on theORN shell, which is determined by its morpho-elastic growth. Calcification of the newest surfaces extends the shell as well as creates a new scaffold that constrains the next growth step. We study the effects of surface and volumetric growth rates, and of previously deposited shell geometries on the resulting modes of shipment."

Our results suggest that the membrane tension is a key element in this fast engulfment, and that the number of SpoIIIAH and SpoIIQ bonds in the cell wall is a primary factor determining the success of the fast engulfment.

We applied interpolation and map algebra methods to evaluate mammalian fauna variables related to small wild mammals and the T. cruzi infection pattern in dogs to identify hotspot areas of transmission. We also evaluated the use of dogs as sentinels of epidemiological risk of Chagas disease. Dogs ( n\u200a=\u200a649 ) were examined by two parasitological and three serological assays. kDNA amplification was performed in patent infections, although the infection was mainly sub-patent in dogs. The distribution of T. cruzi infection in dogs was not homogeneous, ranging from 11\u201389% in different localities. The interpolation method and map algebra were employed to test the associations between the lower richness in mammal species and the risk of exposure of dogs to T. cruzi infection. Geospatial analysis indicated that the reduction of the mammal fauna ( richness and abundance ) was associated with higher parasitemia in small wild mammals and higher exposure of dogs to infection. A Generalized Linear Model ( GLM ) demonstrated that species richness and positive hemocultures in wild mammals were associated with T. cruzi infection in dogs. Domestic canine infection rates differed significantly between areas with and without Chagas disease outbreaks ( Chi-squared test ). We conclude that dog infection is an important indicator for the presence of small wild mammals with high parasitemia and that the lower richness of small mammal species is discussed as a risk factor for the re-emergence of Chagas disease."

The components of this repair process are not well understood, and many important factors are still unknown. We have found that several DNA damage response ( DDR ) factors are important for this repair process. We have found that most of them are from diverse pathways, including the repair of a DNA crosslink, but also the repair of a DNA break. We have also shown that some DDR factors are important for the repair of the c-NHEJ break, a repair process that is likely important for both shortcuting and bypassing c-NHEJ breaks. We have also shown that a cancer therapeutic that blocks the action of one DDR factor can have a significant effect on the repair of the c-NHEJ break, and that this effect is mediated by a second DDR factor. Our results provide new insight into the mechanisms of DNA repair, and may help in the development of new cancer therapies that target DDRs."

Tracking performance monotonically increased with a stiffer band for the worse partner, which had higher tracking error, at the cost of the skilled one\u2019s muscular effort. This suggests that the worse partner followed the skilled one\u2019s lead, but simulations show that the results are better explained by a model where partners share movement goals through the forces, whilst the coupling dynamics determine the capacity of communicable information.

However, it is unclear whether the effects of dietary restriction on intergenerational plasticity depend on the age of the organism, or whether these effects depend on the specific environmental context. Here, we investigate the role of maternal diet on intergenerational plasticity in the roundworm C. elegans. Worms cultured in the larval stage of the worm ( called DR ) produce fewer but larger progeny. Nutrient availability is assessed in larval larvae and young adults, and we show that maternal effects of DR are independent of nutrient availability and that it regulates large progeny size. Genetic analysis suggests that the insulin-like receptor daf-2/InsR in the maternal soma controls progeny size, and that its effector daf-16/FoxO is required for this effect. Furthermore, we show that dietary restriction delays larval starvation and that it grows faster in young worms. Our results indicate that maternal effects of dietary restriction and nutrient stress, compared to an environmental mismatch, can be buffered from early-larval starvation. This work reveals a novel function of maternal provisioning as an organismal response to dietary restriction, identifies conserved pathways that mediate these effects, and identifies potential targets for therapeutic interventions."

We constructed a decision tree model comparing the IgMFA versus clinical diagnosis in a hypothetical cohort with 1000 children in each arm. The costs included direct medical costs only. The eligibility was children ( \u226414 years old ) with fever. Time horizon was day seven from the initial consultation. The number of treatment successes in typhoid fever cases was the intermediate health outcome. We obtained the incremental cost effectiveness ratio ( ICER ), expressed as the difference in costs divided by the difference in the number of treatment success. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. The IgMFA detected 5. 87 more true-positives than the clinical diagnosis ( 38. 45 versus 32. 59 ) per 1000 children and there were 3. 61 more treatment successes ( 46. 78 versus 43. 17 ). The incremental cost of the IgMFA was estimated $5700; therefore, the ICER to have one additional treatment success was estimated to be $1579. The key drivers for the ICER were the relative sensitivity of IgMFA versus clinical diagnosis, the cost of IgMFA, and the prevalence of typhoid fever or multi-drug resistant strains. An IgMFA could be more cost-effective than the clinical diagnosis in the base-case analysis. Decision makers may use a willingness-to-pay threshold that considers the additional cost of hospitalisation for treatment failures."

Using lamprey brain preparations, and electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and tract tracing experiments, we found that olfactory stimulation with natural olors and pheromones induced large excitatory responses in reticulospinal cells, the command neurons for locomotion. We also identified the anatomy and physiology of this neural substrate responsible for transforming an olfactory input into a locomotor output. Our study bridges the gap between behavior and neural mechanisms in vertebrates, identifying a specific subsystem within the CNS, dedicated to producing motor responses to olfactory inputs."

The infection is caused by a parasite, Schistosoma mansoni, which can cause serious disease, such as portal-systemic encephalopathy ( PSE ). PSE is defined as type B hepatic encephalopathy ( BSE ) and is considered to be the most common cause of death in chronic patients with portal-systemic schunting. The lack of diagnostic tools for detecting PSE in patients with other chronic infections, especially in patients with PSE, has been a major problem. In this study, we investigated whether magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) could be a useful tool for diagnosing PSE in chronic patients with suspected PSE. The T1 signal intensity index ( T1SI ) and the apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value were obtained in the Globus pallidus, a tissue that is commonly found in the liver and the bile ducts. Higher T1SI and ADC values, increased lactate and glutamine levels, and decreased myo-inositol were found in the bilateral Globus pallidus in chronic HSJ patients. No significantly abnormal serum ammonia or liver function tests were observed in chronic HSJ patients with PSE. Our results suggest that MRS could be a useful diagnostic tool for detecting PSE in chronic HSJ patients."

This is particularly challenging when the neural plate border is in between the two main embryonic stem cells. How neural crest cells are coordinated to remain in the right place and at the right time is a complex problem. The secreted inhibitors of Bone Morphogenetic Protein ( BMP ) signaling are a class of drugs that suppress neural crest cells. However, BMP inhibitors are not available in the chick nervous system, and their mechanism of action is largely unknown. Here, we have identified a novel mechanism of intracellular attenuation of BMP signaling. Our results show that the activity of a protein called CKIP-1/Smurf1 is required to control the degradation of BMP signaling molecules, and that this activity is required for the proper expression of BMP signaling molecules at the neural plate border. We also show that the overexpression of the CKIP-1/Smurf1 protein causes severe loss of neural crest cells during early embryogenesis. Our results reveal an important mechanism of intracellular attenuation of BMP signaling and provide a new framework for understanding how BMP signaling is regulated during neural crest induction."

These mutations in these genes are not only of interest because they affect the regeneration process, but also because they alter the function of the genes themselves.

We found that topical application of iron chelators or statins reduced fungal growth in the infected mice. Iron chelators also reduced fungal growth in the cornea by 60% and that topical application of iron or the xenosiderophore deferroxamine, which is a highly effective topical iron chelator, inhibited fungal growth in the cornea by 75%.

This process is triggered by the binding of a protein called RAB-2 to a receptor at the cell surface called the GTPase RIC-19. RAB-2 then activates a signaling cascade, which results in the formation of dense core vesicles ( DCVs ), a kind of storage complex that is thought to be involved in this process. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, loss of RAB-2 results in loss of DCVs and consequently, loss of RIC-19. Previous work showed that RAB-2 and its effector, RIC-19, are involved in the maturation of DCVs in C. elegans motoneurons. We have identified a putative RAB-2 GAP, TBC-8, which is exclusively expressed in neurons. Loss of TBC-8 results in a decrease in the amount of DCVs and also in the release of RIC-19. We show that RAB-2 binds to its putative GAP, TBC-8. Interestingly, TBC-8 also binds to the human ortholog of RIC-19. Therefore, we propose that a dynamic ON/OFF cycle of RAB-2 at the Golgi induced by the GAP/effector complex is required for proper DCV maturation."

We also investigated the role of RSR-2 in transcription and found that it is required for the recruitment of RNA Polymerase II ( RNAPII ) to the transcriptome. RSR-2 colocalizes with DNA in germline nuclei and coprecipitates with chromatin, displaying a ChIP-Seq profile similar to that obtained for the RNA Polymerase II ( RNAPII ). Consistently, RSR-2 interacts with RNAPII and affects RNAPII phosphorylation states. Proteomic analyses identified proteins associated with RSR-2 that are involved in different gene expression steps, including RNA metabolism and transcription with PRP-8 and PRP-19 being the most interacting partners. PRP-8 is a core component of the spliceosome and PRP-19 is the core component of the PRP19 complex, which interacts with RNAPII and is necessary for full transcriptional activity.

Global germline loss of Fto resulted in high perinatal lethality and a reduction in body length, fat mass, and lean mass. When ratio corrected for lean mass, mice had a significant increase in energy expenditure, but more appropriate multiple linear regression normalisation showed no difference in energy expenditure. Global deletion of Fto after the in utero and perinatal period, at 6 weeks of age, removed the high lethality of germline loss. However, there was a reduction in weight by 9 weeks, primarily as loss of lean mass. Over the subsequent 10 weeks, weight converged, driven by an increase in fat mass. These results show that global loss of Fto can result in significant changes in body composition, independent of its effect on food intake."

We identify transcription factors that are predicted to coordinate waves of transcription associated with different components of behavioral plasticity. Next, using H3K27Ac as a marker of chromatin accessibility, we show that a brief territorial intrusion was sufficient to cause rapid and dramatic changes in the epigenome. Finally, we integrate the time course brain gene expression data with a transcriptional regulatory network, and link gene expression to changes in chromatin accessibility. This study reveals rapid and dramatic epigenomic plasticity in response to a brief, highly consequential social interaction."

Infection with HSV-1 causes a wide range of diseases, from mild cold to severe disease such as typhoid fever and encephalitis. HSV-1 infection is initiated by a small protein called ICP0, which activates the gene ITR of a cellular enzyme called USP7, which is involved in the removal of abnormal proteins from the cell. USP7 is targeted by several viruses that inhibit the function of USP7. We have determined the structure of the first three USP7 domains bound to a peptide of the viral protein USP7. The USP7 peptide is involved in binding ICP0 and is present in all herpesviruses, but the molecular mechanism of the interaction at this site remains elusive. We have identified a novel binding pocket on USP7, which is present only in the viral protein GMPS and USP7, but not in UHRF1 and GMPS. We have also determined the crystal structure of the USP7-CTD complex in human cells. The structure shows that the USP7 peptide is bound to the C-terminal region of USP7 and that this binding is necessary for the recognition by USP7 of ICP0. Our structural and biochemical data indicate that ICP0 can recruit to the USP7-binding pocket a novel USP7-binding site that is used to protect the enzyme from degradation by the cellular protein USP7."

We found that a CGG repeat, a noncoding element normally associated with gene silencing, is expressed in all three families. The cis-regulatory element is located in the control of a nearby gene, called AFF3. The results suggest that a genetic mutation, FRAXE, causes a dysregulation of this enhancer in all three families. We also demonstrate that the FMR1 gene is a good candidate for a role in motor and language skills in these families. We propose that there may be an association between FRAXE and a delay in the acquisition of motor and language skills in the families studied here."

Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) mutations are used in evolutionary genetics to estimate the divergence times among species and are widely used in the analysis of population history. Inferences of species history are generally based on phylogenetic comparisons, which assume that molecular evolution is clock-like. We directly estimated the mtDNA mutation rate by scanning the mitochondrial genome of Drosophila melanogaster lines that had undergone approximately 200 generations of spontaneous mutation accumulation ( MA ). We detected a total of 28 point mutations and eight insertion-deletion ( indel ) mutations, yielding an estimate for the single-nucleotide mutation rate of 6. 2\u00d7 10\u22128 per site per fly generation. Most mutations were heteroplasmic within a line, and their frequency distribution suggests that the effective number of mitochondrial genomes transmitted per female per generation is about 30. We observed repeated occurrences of some indel mutations, suggesting that indel mutational hotspots are common. Among the point mutations, there is a large excess of G\u2192A mutations on the major strand ( the sense strand for the majority of mitochondrial genes ). These mutations tend to occur at nonsynonymous sites of protein-coding genes, and they are expected to be deleterious, so do not become fixed between species. The overall mtDNA mutation rate per base pair per fly generation in Drosophila is estimated to be about 10\u00d7 higher than the nuclear mutation rate. Silent sites are strongly biased towards A and T than nonsynonymous sites, consistent with the extreme base composition of the mitochondrial genome of Drosophila."

Three congenic strains containing CAST/Ei regions of chromosome 11 were identified that displayed a rapid inflammatory response to LT similar to, but more severe than that driven by a LT-responsive allele of the inflammasome constituent NRLP1B. Importantly, increased response to LT in congenic mice correlated with greater resistance to infection by the Sterne strain of B. anthracis. The genomic region controlling the inflammatory response to LT was mapped to 66. 36\u201374. 67 Mb on chromosome 11, a region that encodes the LT-responsive CAST/Ei allele of Nlrp1b. However, known downstream effects of NLRP1B activation, including macrophage pyroptosis, cytokine release, and leukocyte infiltration could not fully explain the response to LT or the resistance to B. anthracis Sterne in congenic mice. Further, the exacerbated response in congenic mice is inherited in a recessive manner while the Nlrp1b-mediated response to LT is dominant. Finally, congenic mice demonstrated increased responsiveness in a model of sepsis compared with B6 mice. In total, these data suggest that allelic variation of one or more chromosome 11 genes in addition to Nlrp1b controls the severity of host response to multiple inflammatory stimuli and contributes to resistance to B. anthracis Sterne.

These results show that the antiviral activity of macrophages is not a defect per se, but rather a defect in the suppression of antiviral mediators secreted by macrophages.

We use a mathematical model of the zebrafish embryo to show that the uniform partitioning of blood flow through the microvasculature depends on the interplay between the blood flow and the occlusion. We show that this interplay is tuned throughout the network to prevent the blood vessels closest to the heart from short-circuiting the network. This tuning mechanism may underlie the open question of how red blood cells are delivered at the same rate to each micro-vessel.

We found that the parasite is able to survive for many years in the human body by hiding in a layer of secreted products that covers the parasite surface. We show that this mechanism is very similar to those used by the parasite to survive in the body and that the parasite can also be trapped within secretory vesicles, which are structures that are involved in the interaction with the human immune system. The continuous presence of antibodies may serve to prevent the immune-mediated destruction of the parasite by the immune response.

These results suggest that rather than being derived from modern eukaryotic tubulin, BtubA and BtubB evolved from a common ancestor of tubulin intermediates. Since we show that bacterial microtubules can be produced in vitro without chaperones, they should be useful tools for tubulin research and drug screening."

These structures are thought to be involved in information processing in the cell. However, the spatial organization of the microtubule-based structures is poorly understood. The problem is that the large number of possible configurations of the microtubule network, and the presence of molecular crowding, make the problem of determining the most physiologically relevant configurations very challenging. Here, we develop a computational model that allows for the efficient simulation of calcium dynamics in a microtubule-based model. We find that for moderate crowding, calcium dynamics is mainly regulated by the cytoplasmic concentration, but not by the cytoplasmic crowding, dendritic spines or synaptic inputs. We also show that calcium dynamics is mainly regulated by the buffer concentration, but not by the cytoplasmic crowding, dendritic spines or synaptic inputs."

We used precise methods of enumeration and in vivo labeling with 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine to track recently divided pDC in blood and tissue compartments of monkeys with acute pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) infection. We show that pDC are lost from blood and peripheral lymph nodes within 14 days of infection, despite a normal frequency of pDC in bone marrow. Paradoxically, pDC loss masked a highly dynamic response characterized by rapid pDC mobilization into blood and a 10- to 20-fold increase in recruitment to lymph nodes relative to uninfected animals. Nevertheless, remaining pDC had essentially normal functional responses to stimulation through Toll-like receptor 7, with half of lymph node pDC producing both TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1. These findings reveal that rapid cell migration and death both contribute to pDC depletion in acute SIV infection."

EBNA3C is an essential latent antigen expressed in proliferating B-cell lines and is also required for B-cell immortalization. EBNA3C activates E2F1, which is a key transcription factor in the DNA damage response pathway, to induce apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate that EBNA3C also blocks E2F1-mediated apoptosis through its DNA-binding activity at the p73 and Apaf-1 promoters, which is responsible for the induction of apoptosis. We also demonstrate that EBNA3C represses E2F1 transcriptional activity via blocking its DNA-binding activity at the responsive promoters of p73 and Apaf-1 apoptosis induced genes, and also facilitates E2F1 degradation in an ubiquitin-proteasome dependent manner. Importantly, in response to DNA damage, E2F1 knockdown LCLs exhibited a significant reduction in apoptosis with higher cell-viability. These findings reveal that E2F1 is a key player in the DNA damage response pathway and its inhibition by EBNA3C results in a reduction in apoptosis and cell-viability. This study offers novel insights into EBV biology and provides a potential therapeutic target against EBV associated B-cell lymphomas."

These routes are usually defined as distinct from each other, and the relative importance of each route varies critically between the particular species. However, the relative importance of each route is difficult to determine, as often the numbers of cases are vastly different across the various routes. We developed a mathematical approach that can accurately predict which route of transmission, given the specific case counts of each pathogen, and then applied this method to a novel mathematical model of the Zika virus ( ZIKV ) outbreak in West Africa. We found that, for an important reason, the ZIKV epidemic was under-estimated.

In this theoretical study, we show that by allowing the signaling state of individual receptors to persist during brief unbinding events, T cells are able to discriminate antigens based on both their unbinding and rebinding rates. We demonstrate that T cell receptor coreceptors, but not receptor clustering, are important in promoting localized rebinding, and show that requiring rebinding for productive signaling reduces signals from a high concentration of endogenous pMHC.

Furthermore, we show that the disease-relevant mutant SOX3 protein is present in the nucleus of mutant cells, and that it can rescue a block in gastrulation but is not sufficient for normal development of the hypothalamus, a region that is functionally compromised in Sox3 null embryos and individuals with XH.

IRF-1 is activated when VSV is present in the bloodstream, and its antiviral action is mediated by the type I interferon response. This antiviral action is also required later in infection, when IRF-1 is induced in the central nervous system ( CNS ).

Interestingly, gene conversion also involving Future2 at the C-terminus was observed at the C-terminus.

The molecular mechanisms involved in this removal are known in both animals and yeast. However, there are very few examples of positions in the genome that are associated with this process.

Here we have used a panel of DNA sequence variants in a 6. 2 Mbp region of mouse chromosome 17 to identify a 12 QTL, which we have termed Tir1. We performed next-generation sequencing to identify a 1, 428 common single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in Tir1, and we found evidence that it is a likely non-synonymous SNP in the region, which we have validated by an in vitro assay. We also developed a comparative genomics approach to identify 12 loci with copy number variants ( CNV ) that correlate with differential gene expression, including one that lies close to the peak of Tir3c and has gene expression that correlates with CNV and phenotype. Our strategy can be used to identify a short list of polymorphisms in candidate QTL genes that can be functionally tested."

The infectious agent in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( TSEs ) is an unorthodox protein conformation based agent. Recent successes in producing mammalian prion in vitro with recombinant prion protein provide strong support for the hypothesis that the infectious agent in TSEs is an unorthodox protein conformation. However, whether the pathogenic properties of synthetically generated prion ( rec-Prion ) recapitulate those of naturally occurring prions remains unresolved. Using end-point titration assay, we showed that rec-Prion has infectious titers of around 104 LD50/\u03bcg. In addition, inoculation of wild-type mice with rec-Prion caused prion disease with an average survival time of 210 \u2013 220 days post inoculation. Detailed pathological analyses revealed that the nature of rec-Prion induced lesions, including spongiform change, disease specific prion protein accumulation ( PrP-d ) and the PrP-d dissemination amongst lymphoid and peripheral nervous system tissues, the route and mechanisms of neuroinvasion were all typical of the infectious agent. Our results established that, similar to naturally occurring prions, the rec-Prion has a titratable infectivity and is capable of causing prion disease via routes other than direct intra-cerebral challenge."

The whisker arrays that are found in the mammalian skin, which are the mammalian skin sensors, are organized in arrays of two kinds of vibrissae: they are connected to the whiskers and they connect the surface at the same position. We used a 3-dimensional model of the whisker array to construct mappings between the horizontal angle of contact of each vibrissa and every possible configuration of the head relative to a flat surface. These mappings revealed striking differences in the patterns of contact for vibrissae in different regions of the array. The exterior ( A, D, E ) rows provide information about the relative pitch of the surface regardless of distance. The interior ( B, C ) rows provide distance cues regardless of head pitch. Yaw is linearly correlated with the difference between the number of right and left whiskers touching the surface. Compared to the long reaches that whiskers can make to the side and below the rat, the accessible distance in front of the rat\u2019s nose is relatively small. These results suggest that vibrissae in different regions of the array are not interchangeable sensors, but rather functionally grouped to acquire particular types of information about the environment."

The immune response to these pathogens is governed by the Toll-like receptor ( TLR ), a membrane protein that is expressed on the surface of T cells and plays a critical role in regulating the immune response to these pathogens. We show that the presence of filarial infections significantly decreases the expression of TLR2 and TLR9, which are important for the control of Mtb infection. In addition, we show that in the presence of filarial infection, the expression of TLR2 and TLR9 is significantly diminished. The expression of TLR2 and TLR9 is also significantly diminished in individuals with latent tuberculosis, suggesting that these two receptors are co-expressed in the same cells. Blocking TLR2 and TLR9 expression in individuals with latent tuberculosis results in the restoration of the cytokine responses in these individuals. In addition, we show that coinfection with filarial parasites significantly decreases the expression of TLR2 and TLR9 in these individuals. Thus, these results suggest that in addition to the role of TLR2 and TLR9 as mediators of protection, these receptors also play a major role in the control of Mtb infection."

We found that Vvl is necessary for the onset of larval development, but it also controls molting behavior. Inhibition of molting by a JH analog reduced the expression of JH biosynthesis genes, as well as the expression of a JH biosynthesis gene, JH acid methyltransferase 3 ( JH acid methyltransferase 3; JHac ). In addition, ecdysone, a JH biosynthesis gene, and the hormone receptor 3 ( HR3 ) were reduced in vvl knockdown larvae. Injection of 20-hydroxyecdysone into vvl knockdown larvae could restore the expression of HR3. These results suggest that Vvl coordinates both JH and ecdysteroids biosynthesis as well as molting behavior to influence molting and the timing of metamorphosis.

We first evaluated 446 non\u2013Major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) variants in genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) of populations of European ancestry. We then tested these variants in our combined Caucasian SLE cohorts of 2, 071 controls and 1, 500 cases.

We also found evidence for shared SLE association with other autoimmune diseases, including IL23R. These findings support a relatively distinct genetic susceptibility for SLE. We also found that the shared SLE loci did not appear to be associated with other ADs. This study represents the most comprehensive evaluation of shared autoimmune loci to date, provides further evidence for previously and newly identified shared genes in SLE, and highlights the value of studies of potentially pleiotropic genes in autoimmune diseases."

We find that each species has independently evolved different, adaptations to compensate for changes in the genomic landscape. We also show that the organization of the sequences that control gene expression is fine-tuned by different, lineage-specific selection pressures in each of the three species. Specifically, we show that the site composition and organization of the sequences that control gene expression in one species can be adjusted to compensate for lineage-specific developmental and/or genomic changes. Furthermore, by precisely altering the organization of the sequences with different morphogen gradient thresholds, we show that the functional organization of the sequences that control gene expression is sufficient for explaining changes in enhancer activity. Thus, our study demonstrates that evolution can act on functional sequences to fine-tune the readouts of a gradient."

We use mathematical modeling to investigate the mechanisms of iron release from the macrophages. The passive-gradient model is commonly used to analyze iron release from whole-body iron metabolism. However, it cannot account for the cellular iron uptake. We have investigated the roles of FPN, FPN and apo-Tf in iron release and developed a facilitated-transport model.

Proteasome subunits are highly conserved across eukaryotes, from yeast to humans, and are involved in the repair of DNA damage. Here, we show that the subunit of the proteasome, Mms22, is involved in DNA repair. Mms22 is recruited to chromatin in a temperature dependent manner, and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome leads to cell cycle arrest. This work shows for the first time that a proteasome subunit is a target of the cell. Moreover, it links nuclear proteasome activity and DSB repair."

While many of the genes and genetic elements that underlie the development of the genetic basis of bacterial evolution have been identified, much less is known about how much of the genetic basis of the evolution of bacterial species is also responsible for the adaptation of these bacteria to new environments. Here, we use a simulation of the evolution of bacterial populations to show that the rate at which bacteria evolve is determined by the genetic basis of the recombination that occurs among the members of the same species. We also show that recombination is not a necessary prerequisite for the evolution of bacteria, and that the rate at which bacteria adapt to new environments is determined by the rate at which they recombine.

The intensity of the magnetic field depends on the position of the magnetic coil relative to the brain. The induced electric field depends on the shape and location of the coil relative to the brain. Although TMS has been used for several decades, the biophysical basis underlying the stimulation of neurons in the central nervous system ( CNS ) is still unknown. To address this problem, we developed a mathematical model enabling us to combine realistic magnetic stimulation ( MS ) with compartmental modeling of neurons. We found that the induced electric field for each segment of the neuron was combined with standard compartmental modeling software to calculate the membrane current generated by the electromagnetic field for each segment of the neuron. In agreement with previous studies, the simulations suggested that peripheral axons were excited by the spatial gradients of the induced electric field. In both peripheral and central neurons, MS amplitude required for action potential generation was inversely proportional to the square of the diameter of the stimulated compartment. Moreover, the induced electric field depolarized the soma followed by initiation of an action potential in the initial segment of the axon. The results suggest that MS does not directly trigger dendritic regenerative mechanisms. These insights may be important for the design of multi-intensity TMS protocols, may facilitate the interpretation of results from TMS of the CNS, and may contribute to understanding the mechanism of MS."

This intracellular parasite transforms other mammalian cells, making them more susceptible to infection and death. The mechanisms behind this phenotype are poorly understood.

While many efforts have been undertaken to identify the activation mechanism of IKK, the precise activation mechanism by which catalytic IKK subunits gain the ability to induce NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity is still unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of human IKK2 in its catalytically active conformation. The structure shows that the hIKK2 domain architecture closely resembles that of Xenopus IKK2. However, inactivated xIKK2 adopts an open conformation that permits higher order oligomerization within the crystal. Reversible oligomerization of hIKK2 dimers is observed in solution, and mutations that disrupt oligomerization are found in the surface regions that mediate interaction with other molecules. We propose that IKK2 dimers transiently associate with one another through these interaction surfaces to promote trans auto-phosphorylation as part of their mechanism of activation. This structure-based model supports recently published structural data that implicate strand exchange as a mechanism for IKK2 activation via trans auto-phosphorylation. Moreover, oligomerization through the interfaces identified in this study and subsequent trans auto-phosphorylation account for the rapid amplification of IKK2 phosphorylation observed even in the absence of any upstream kinase."

Neutrophils are a critical cell type that recruit immune cells to the site of infection and mediate the host defense; however, neutrophils are also associated with immunopathology and play a role in the development of kidney disease. Here we demonstrate that in vivo infection with the yeast Candida results in a severe systemic inflammatory response characterized by neutrophils accumulating in the kidney and other organs. We demonstrate that this neutrophil response is dependent on chemokine receptors expressed on the surface of neutrophils. When neutrophils from patients with invasive candidiasis were adoptively transferred into mice lacking Ccr1, a receptor expressed on neutrophils, they observed increased numbers of neutrophils in the kidney and increased kidney injury, which was associated with mortality. These findings identify a role for chemokine receptors in promoting severe immunopathology and mortality in invasive candidiasis, and suggest a mechanism by which neutrophils can be recruited from the blood to the organ."

Here we have investigated the mechanism of genome release of poliovirus and two related foot-and-mouth disease viruses, which are distantly related to FMDV, but have very different genome compositions. We found that the sensitivity of genome translocation of poliovirus is dependent on the ability of the virus to replicate to high levels in the endosome. We also found that poliovirus genome translocation is insensitive to RNase A and results in little or no release into the medium in the liposome model. We also found that all poliovirus genomes that are internalized into cells, not only those resulting in infection, are protected from RNase A. These results support a finely coordinated, directional model of viral RNA delivery that involves viral proteins and cellular membranes."

We also show that this polymorphic RNA isoform does not express the full-length protein, which is an important determinant of telomerase function. We also show that the RNA isoform of hTERT, which does not encode the full-length protein, can be expressed in cells lacking an RNA isoform. Additionally, we show that the RNA isoform of hTERT is able to bind to the telomerase RNA subunit, resulting in decreased telomerase activity.

Here, we uncover a role for microRNAs in limiting the spatiotemporal range of Wnt1/Wnt signaling and the size of the dopamine progenitor domain. We find that this regulatory circuit involves the transcription factor Lmx1b and a new microRNA, miR135a2, which restricts Wnt1/Wnt signaling and the allocation of dopamine progenitors. Loss of this circuit in embryonic stem cells results in reduced proliferation and expansion of the dopamine progenitor domain. Conditional loss of Dicer1 in embryonic stem cells causes expansion of the dopamine progenitor domain. We show that this mutant displays reductions in the size of the Lmx1b/Wnt1 domain and that this region of the Wnt signaling pathway is involved in the modulation of downstream Wnt signaling. Our results suggest that microRNA modulation of the Lmx1b/Wnt axis in the early midbrain/isthmus could determine midbrain size and allocation of dopamine progenitors."

One condition that could be highly informative here is Charles Bonnet syndrome ( CBS ), in which visual hallucinations and other visual anomalies occur when there is no actual visual input. CBS could be taken as indication that there is a generative model in the brain that can explain, predict, and learn about sensory data. We argue that a model recently introduced in machine learning, the deep Boltzmann machine ( DBM ), could capture the relevant aspects of ( hypothetical ) generative processing in the cortex. The latter allows us to model a concrete neural mechanism that could underlie CBS, namely acetylcholine. We show that homeostatic plasticity could serve to make the learned internal model robust against e. g. degradation of sensory input, but overcompensate in the case of CBS, leading to hallucinations. We demonstrate how a wide range of features of CBS can be explained in the model and suggest a potential role for the neuromodulator acetylcholine.

In our study, we have shown that blood monocyte gene expression is an important marker for distinguishing patients with NCC from patients with other forms of NCC.

To ensure this, the replication of the chromosomal loci is carefully controlled. A well-known example is the fact that during mitosis, the replication of the chromosomal loci is either rapidly or non- rapidly replicating. Here, we provide a better understanding of how DNA replication is controlled during mitotic cell division. We found that two DNA replication proteins ARTEMIS and XPF, which are known to limit the occurrence of chromosomal instability, also induce stalled DNA replication forks breakage through non-epistatic pathways all along S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Moreover, we found that XPF and AR TEMIS are recruited to the chromatin to promote replication fork restart. Finally, we demonstrated that XPF and AR TEMIS are required to prevent mitotic segregation defects. Collectively, these results reveal that AR TEMIS and XPF are required to maintain the fidelity of DNA replication and limit chromosomal instability."

In mammals, molecular clocks are thought to rely on negative feedback loops in gene expression that drive daily rhythms in the expression of clock-controlled genes, such as the orphan receptor REV-ERB\u03b1. To gain insight into the clock output functions of REV-ERB\u03b1, we have carried out genome-wide profiling experiments with liver RNA from wild-type mice, Rev-ymb\u03b1 knock-out mice, or REV-ERB\u03b1 overexpressing mice. We concluded that REV-ERB\u03b1 participates in the circadian modulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein ( SREBP ) activity, and thereby in the daily expression of SREBP target genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. This control is exerted via the cyclic transcription of Insig2, encoding a trans-membrane protein that sequesters SREBP proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and thereby interferes with the proteolytic activation of SREBPs in Golgi membranes. We found that this control acts via the stimulation of LXR nuclear receptors by cyclically produced oxysterols. In conclusion, our study suggests that this control acts via the stimulation of LXR nuclear receptors by cyclically produced oxysterols.

In this study, we show that the plant immune system utilizes the innate immune response to restrict cell death during plant-pathogen interactions. Inactivation of the plant immune system does not result in spontaneous lesions, and enhanced cell death in psig1 mutants is independent of SA biosynthesis or reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production. Moreover, PSIG1 interacts with SMG7, which plays a role in nonsense-mediated RNA decay ( NMD ), and the smg7-4 mutant mimics the cell death phenotype of the psig1 mutants. Intriguingly, the psig1 mutants show enhanced susceptibility to the hemi-biotrophic bacterial pathogen.

In this study, we have characterized two proteins from B. malayi ( Bm-FAR-1 and Bm-FAR-2 ) that are used in vaccine and antigenic studies. We show that these proteins bind to similar ligands ( retinol and cis-parinaric acid ), but that only one of them, rBm-FAR-1, is capable of activating specific antibodies in people and individuals with a history of infection. The two proteins are expressed in a water-in-oil-emulsion, and their water solubility is higher than that of the human homolog.

We show that immune cells, specifically T regulatory cells, are important in controlling the immune response to the pneumococcus in mice and humans. Blocking their induction by the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-\u03b2 prevents mice from succumbing to infection and increases lung inflammation. Conversely, transplantation of T regulatory cells into mice prior to infection improves their ability to control the infection and decreases the spread of the bacteria from the lungs to blood. Our study indicates that TGF-\u03b2 signalling is a potential target for immunotherapy and that TGF-\u03b2 may be a potential therapeutic target for fighting against pneumococcal pneumonia."

This assumption is a common assumption in comparative genomics, which can be used to predict the function of proteins. Here we present the first large-scale test of the ortholog conjecture using comparative functional genomic data from human and mouse. We show that orthologs and paralogous proteins are often functionally more similar than each other than are orthologs, even in different species. We also find that paralogous pairs residing on the same chromosome are more functionally similar than those on different chromosomes.

A region of the S. aureus genome known as the F region contains two similar open reading frames that are translated into the F region itself. The F region is also the site where methicillin binds to the DNA. In this study, we used a genetic approach to introduce the F region of S. aureus into two different strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus ( MSA ). We found that the expression of the psm-mec F region protein and the transcription of the psm-mec F region protein, which is known to be a regulatory RNA, are required for methicillin resistance. Furthermore, the production of PSM\u03b1, a methicillin-susceptible toxin, is reduced when the psm-mec F region is mutated. These findings suggest that the F region regulates methicillin resistance by controlling the production of the PSM\u03b1 toxin, which is a key virulence factor of S. aureus."

The first phase transitions from a faster to a slower decay rate before the start of the usual second phase. In the current study, we investigate the intracellular mechanisms responsible for these complex plasma virus decay dynamics by investigating the effect of different drug classes on the decay of HIV RNA plasma virus levels. We find that for most drug classes the first phase transitions from a faster to a slower decay region, and the slower decay rate, the more rapid the increase in the amount of HIV RNA in the blood.

In this paper, we propose a simple model to describe the evolution of adaptive immunity against phage infection in bacterial populations. We show that the model can account for several observations. First, if the DNA sequences are acquired well, the model predicts that bacteria can evolve to infect new niches. Second, if the sequences are not acquired, the model predicts that the bacteria will develop a diverse population of spacers. third, if the spacers differ in their ability to confer immunity, the model predicts that bacteria will develop a specialized spacer distribution.

The Nup358 protein is a cylophilin homolog and a master regulator of cellular homeostasis and, consequently, it is required for a broad range of cellular functions. This is supported by the fact that Nup358 is required for HIV-1 nuclear translocation and, in turn, the growth of the viral capsids. The Nup358 cyclophilin homologs in human and mouse cells are the only human cyclophilins that are required for HIV-1 infection. We also show that the Nup358 cyclophilin is dispensable for HIV-1 replication in human CD4+ T cells and for the prevention of the virus from reaching the nucleus.

We introduce a computational model of enamel matrix secretion to map the dentine topography to the enamel surface topography. Starting from experimental data of the pig molars, we show how diffusion-limited matrix deposition accounts for both the process of matrix secretion and the final enamel distribution. Simulations reveal how concave and convex dentine features have distinct effects on enamel surface, thereby explaining why the enamel surface is not a straightforward extrapolation of the dentine template. Human and orangutan molar simulations show that even subtle variations in dentine topography can be mapped to the enamel surface features.

Rescue of misfolded \u0394F508-CFTR under low temperature conditions restored viral transduction efficiency to that demonstrated in controls.

It is characterized by weakness and spasticity of the lower limb, a characteristic feature of which is the degeneration of the corticospinal axons. The molecular mechanism underlying the degeneration of the corticospinal axons is still unknown. Mutations in the microtubule ( MT ) -severing protein, spastin, are the most common cause of HSP. We now show that spastin can bind to lipid droplets, a cell type involved in lipid metabolism, and regulate lipid synthesis. Moreover, spastin is involved in the regulation of fat stores and levels of triacylglycerol, a major metabolic product in the body. Inhibition of lipid droplets in Drosophila larvae reduces fat stores and reduces levels of triacylglycerol in the larvae. Our results suggest that inhibition of lipid droplets in axons may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HSP."

Chemosensory information is often relayed to the brain by sensory neurons that detect the presence of a chemical in the environment. In response, these neurons integrate their internal and external information to determine whether and how they can detect and respond to chemicals. We studied the chemoreceptor gene Mr-234, whose expression is regulated by the insulin-like receptor and the neuropeptide receptor. We found that the sense of food and internal state of the animal determines whether Mr-234 can be detected and respond to chemicals. We show that the DAF-2 receptor for the insulin-like receptor, which is involved in food sensing, also contributes to the regulation of Mr-234 expression. Moreover, we show that the receptor for NPR-1, which is involved in the response to sugar, also contributes to regulation of Mr-234 expression. Finally, we show that the DAF-2 receptor for the insulin-like receptor and NPR-1 receptor act in a negative feedback mechanism to regulate Mr-234 expression. Our results suggest that sensory and circuit inputs may integrate multiple pathways to allow animals to precisely regulate and fine-tune their chemosensory responses as a function of internal and external conditions."

We compared detailed stochastic models to the empirical data to identify the rate limiting steps with temperature changes and the role of temperature in controlling the rate of transcription. Our analysis also revealed different mechanisms of transcription regulation by temperature. We found that temperature affects the rate limiting steps unequally, as nonlinear changes in the closed complex formation can explain the differences in transcription dynamics between conditions. Finally, we used the derived models to explore a possible cause for why the identified steps are preferred as the main cause for behavior modifications with temperature: we find that transcription dynamics is either insensitive or responds reciprocally to changes in the other steps. Our results suggest that different promoters employ different rate limiting step patterns that control not only their rate and variability, but also their sensitivity to environmental changes."

Recently, we showed that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor H1 ( GEF-H1 ), a protein that is involved in the host response to pathogens, is essential for the activation of the host innate immune response. Surprisingly, we found that GEF-H1 is required for activation of the host innate immune response by Shigella effector proteins. In response to Shigella infection, GEF-H1 is required for activation of the host innate immune response by host cytosolic effectors, which are known to be Nod1 and RhoA activating factors. This work has uncovered a novel function of GEF-H1 in the host response to Shigella infection and demonstrates that GEF-H1 is a critical component of the cellular defense response."

Here, we address this question by analyzing the transcriptome and binding profile of SOX2 in embryonic mouse cortex, spinal cord, stomach and lung/endoderm derived organs. We demonstrate that, although SOX2 binds a similar motif in the different cell types, its target regions are primarily cell-type-specific and enriched for the distinct binding motifs of appropriately expressed interacting co-factors. Furthermore, we show that SOX2 binding in endodermal and neural cells is most often found around genes specifically expressed in the corresponding tissue. Consistently, SOX2 binding sites found in both endodermal and neural tissues are associated with genes regulating general stem cell features, such as proliferation. Notably, SOX2 regulates proliferation through conserved mechanisms and target genes in both germ layers examined. Together, these findings demonstrate how SOX2 simultaneously regulates cell-type-specific, as well as core transcriptional programs in neural and endodermal stem cells."

We found that helminth-helminth and helminth-intestinal protozoan infections were significantly more common than single infections, while individuals with malaria, TB, and HIV were more likely to be singly-infected with these infections than co-infected with at least one helminth.

Here, we show that mTOR is indispensable for cranial neural crest cells ( NCCs ), which are a temporary type of cells arising from the ectoderm layer and migrating to the pharyngeal arches, which are required for craniofacial development. mTOR deletion elicited a proliferation deficit and excessive apoptosis of post-migratory NCCs, leading to growth arrest of the facial primordia along with midline orofacial clefts. Furthermore, NCC differentiation was impaired. We further demonstrate that disruption of mTOR caused P53 hyperactivity and cell cycle arrest in cranial NCCs, and reducing P53 activity by one copy reduction attenuated the craniofacial phenotype in NCC-mTOR knockout mice. Remarkably, NCC-Rptor disruption caused a spectrum of defects mirroring that of the NCC-mTOR deletion, whereas NCC-Rictor disruption only caused a mild craniofacial phenotype compared to the mTOR and Rptor conditional knockout models. Altogether, our data demonstrate that mTOR functions mediated by mTORC1 are indispensable for multiple processes of NCC development including proliferation, survival, and differentiation during craniofacial morphogenesis and organogenesis, and P53 hyperactivity in part accounts for the defective craniofacial development in NCC-mTOR knockout mice."

We develop a novel method for cross phenotype meta-analysis ( CPMA ) which detects association of a SNP to multiple, but not necessarily all, phenotypes. With it, we find evidence that 47/107 ( 44% ) immune-mediated disease risk SNPs are associated to multiple, but not all, immune-mediated diseases ( SNP-wise PCPMA<0. 01 ). We also show that distinct groups of interacting proteins are encoded near SNPs which predispose to the same subsets of diseases; we propose these as the mechanistic basis of shared disease risk.

The structural and biochemical properties of integrin receptors are not yet understood, and in particular, it remains controversial whether the clustering of integrin receptors occurs following the activation of the integrin, or whether the regulation of integrin clustering is mediated by the activation of the integrin itself.

In an effort to define the role of PAN RNA in the context of the virus genome we generated a recombinant BACmid that deleted the PAN RNA locus. We show that deletion of the PAN RNA locus produced a general decrease in the expression of immediate early, early and late genes. Most strikingly, K-Rta expression was decreased in lytically induced BAC36CR\u0394PAN-containing cell lines. Expression of PAN RNA in trans in BAC36CR\u0394PAN containing cells resulted in an increase in K-Rta expression, however K-Rta over expression failed to rescue BAC36CR\u0394PAN, suggesting that PAN RNA plays a wider role in virus replication.

In this study, we have monitored the rate of transcription of the Spo0A promoter during growth in the presence of an external stimulus. We find that the growth pauses induce a burst of Spo0A transcription, which then reflects the activity of the gene. The burst is followed by the production of a phosphorylated form of Spo0A. We propose that this is a reaction to the stress that brings the average cell closer to the thresholds for transition to bimodally expressed developmental responses. We have measured the numbers of cells expressing a competence marker before and after the bursts and found that the increase in Spo0A transcription that accompanies the entrance to stationary phase is delayed and sporulation is markedly diminished. In spite of this, our data contradicts the hypothesis that sporulation is initiated when a decrease in the GTP pool relieves repression by CodY, a well-known negative regulator of sporulation.

In the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), macrophages must respond to Mtb by activating transcription factors and cytokines. The same is true for the activation of the transcription factor KLF4. In this study, we found that downregulation of miR-26a ( miR-26a ) and upregulation of C/ebpbeta ( C/EBP\u03b2 ) also occurs during Mtb infection. We further show that C/EBP\u03b2 is required for the M2 polarization. Downregulation of miR-26a and upregulation of C/EBP\u03b2 also occur in infected macrophages. These results indicate that, during Mtb infection, miR-26a and upregulation of C/EBP\u03b2 are crucial for the activation of the transcription factor KLF4. Loss of these pathways results in reduced expression of selected M2 markers such as IL10 and Irf4. We also show that downregulation of miR-26a mimic or knockdown of KLF4 or Creb or C/ebpbeta attenuates the survival of Mtb in macrophages. These results suggest that miR-26a and upregulation of C/EBP\u03b2 are crucial for the survival of Mtb in macrophages. This study opens up new exploratory avenues for host-targeted interventions."

The induction of a Th1-like response against the LiPABP family by genetic vaccination was able to down-regulate the IL-10-mediated responses elicited by parasite LiPABPs after infection in this murine model. LiPABP vaccinated mice showed a reduction on the pathology that was accompanied by a decrease in parasite loads, in antibody titers against Leishmania antigens and in the IL-4 and IL-10 parasite-specific responses in comparison to control mice groups immunized with saline or with the non-recombinant plasmid.

Loss of either HAI-1 or -2 causes embryonic lethality in mice, which can be rescued by inactivation of the membrane-anchored serine protease, matriptase, thereby demonstrating that matriptase-dependent proteolytic pathways are critical developmental targets for both protease inhibitors. To identify new components of this pathway, we have generated mice with combined deficiency in either HAI-1 or HAI-2, along with genes encoding developmentally co-expressed candidate matriptase targets, and screening for the rescue of embryonic lethality. We demonstrate that matriptase activation is a critical developmental target for both protease inhibitors, as loss of matriptase activity results in placental failure, neural tube defects in HAI-2\u2013deficient embryos, and embryonic lethality in HAI-1\u2013deficient embryos. Inactivation of genes encoding c-Met, protease-activated receptor-2 ( PAR-2 ), or the epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) alpha subunit all failed to rescue embryonic lethality, suggesting that deregulated matriptase-prostasin activity causes developmental failure independent of aberrant c-Met and PAR-2 signaling or impaired epithelial sodium transport. Furthermore, inactivation of the matriptase and prostasin gene double-deficient placental tissues revealed that prostasin is critical for conversion of the matriptase zymogen to active matriptase, whereas matriptase- and prostasin-activated embryos are matriptase-independent. These results suggest that the protease may not be critical for focal proteolytic activation of the prostasin pathway during neural tube closure. Paradoxically, although matriptase auto-activates and is a well-established upstream epidermal activator of prostasin, biochemical analysis of matriptase- and prostasin-activated embryos reveals that prostasin is not necessary for conversion of the matriptase zymogen to active matriptase, whereas matriptase- and prostasin-activated embryos are matriptase-independent."

This is the first evidence that macrophages are able to kill an intracellular bacterial pathogen in a process similar to the innate immune response. We investigated whether this effect is mediated by the Nlrc4 inflammasome, which is known to induce caspase-1 activation and cell death, and whether the activation of caspase-7 is required for this effect. We show that the activation of caspase-7 is mediated by the Nlrc4 inflammasome and requires caspase-1 activation.

In this species, gene amplification of specific loci has been described in all three domains of life. A bioinformatics screen revealed that repeated sequences are widely distributed in the Leishmania genome and the repeats are chromosome-specific, conserved among species, and generally present in low copy number. Using sensitive PCR assays, we provide evidence that the Leishmania genome is continuously being rearranged at the level of these repeated sequences, which serve as a functional platform for constitutive and stochastic amplification ( and deletion ) of genomic segments in the population. This process is adaptive as the copy number of beneficial extrachromosomal circular or linear elements increases upon selective pressure and is reversible when selection is removed. We also provide mechanistic insights on the formation of circular and linear amplicons through RAD51 recombinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. The whole genome of Leishmania is thus stochastically rearranged at the level of repeated sequences, and the selection of parasite subpopulations with changes in the copy number of specific loci is used as a strategy to respond to a changing environment."

Although many studies have focused on how IFN\u03b3 activates cells to restrict the growth of bacteria, it is not known how this activation occurs. We investigated how IFN\u03b3 activates cells to restrict the replication of Shigella flexneri, a bacterium that infects human macrophages, cells of which IFN\u03b3 is critical for limiting their replication. We found that IFN\u03b3 activates a cytoplasmic sensor of RNA, RIG-I, which in turn activates downstream signaling pathways that inhibit S. flexneri growth. The RIG-I-dependent signaling adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein ( MAVS ), which is a downstream adaptor of RIG-I, is also required for this restriction. The results provide a new understanding of how IFN\u03b3 activates cells to restrict the growth of bacterial pathogens within host cells."

Its development involves the specification of a molecular circuitry that is important for the function of the brain. The zebrafish inner ear is a valuable model organism to study neurogenic development, because it is easy to study the genetic requirements for each cell type in the whole organism. Here we show that the signalling pathways FGF and RA are required in the zebrafish inner ear to establish the patterns of gene expression that give rise to the three cell types that are found in the inner ear. This is a striking example of how a single signalling pathway can alter the expression of multiple genes to produce different cell types in different organs. This mechanism of regulation has a simple mechanism and is surprisingly different from the previously described requirement for RA signalling in specification of non-neural cell types. This study demonstrates how the action of a single signalling pathway can have different effects on different cell types."

We find that the termination of Pol II transcription of non-coding RNA genes is largely dependent on the combined action of proteins in the Sen1-dependent pathway. Furthermore, we identify two novel targets and functions of Sen1-dependent termination, including a role in repression of meiotic genes in vegetative cells. Our results provide exciting new insights into how Pol II transcription termination is controlled in S. cerevisiae and will be important for understanding how Pol II transcription termination is controlled in other eukaryotic cells."

The antagonism of RNase L by L* was particularly prominent in macrophages where baseline oligoadenylate synthetase ( OAS ) and RNase L expression levels are elevated. L* counteracted the OAS/RNase L pathway through direct interaction with the ankyrin domain of RNase L, resulting in the inhibition of this enzyme. Interestingly, RNase L inhibition was species-specific as Theiler's virus L* protein blocked murine RNase L but not human RNase L or RNase L of other mammals or birds. Direct RNase L inhibition by L* and species specificity were confirmed in an in vitro assay performed with purified proteins.

To address this problem, we have performed a large-scale screen of a collection of 3762 single gene mutants in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, accounting for 2/3 of yeast ORFs, to search for mutants that undergo an atypically high number of cell divisions. Many of the potential longevity genes map to cellular processes not previously implicated in mitotic senescence, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms governing mitotic exit may be broader than currently anticipated. We focused on an ER-Golgi gene cluster isolated in this screen to determine how these ubiquitous organelles integrate into mitotic longevity. We report that an ER-Golgi pathway is required for autophagy, a catabolic process that accelerates the trafficking of high molecular weight protein aggregates from the cytoplasm to the vacuoles, and is evolutionarily conserved, as it also extends reproductive lifespan in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Our data provide evidence that catabolic networks of protein aggregate are among the drivers of mitotic longevity in eukaryotes."

In Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, the embryo is surrounded by a single cell endosperm layer itself surrounded by a seed coat layer, the testa. We identified cutin biosynthesis genes that are required for seed germination. Cutin-containing layers are present in seed coats of numerous species, including Arabidopsis, where they regulate permeability to outer compounds. However, the role of cutin in mature seed physiology and germination remains poorly understood. Here we identify in mature seeds a thick cuticular film covering the entire outer surface of the endosperm. This seed cuticle is defective in cutin-deficient bodyguards1 seeds, which is associated with alterations in endospermic permeability. Furthermore, mutants affected in cutin biosynthesis show low seed dormancy and viability levels, which correlates with higher levels of seed lipid oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that in the course of land plant evolution cuticular structures were co-opted to achieve key physiological seed properties."

In this study, we show that OsWOX4, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX gene family, is involved in the regulation of leaf development in rice. Inducible downregulation of OsWOX4 resulted in severe defects in leaf development, such as an arrest of vascular differentiation, a partial defect in the early cell proliferation required for midrib formation, and a failure to maintain cellular activity in general parenchyma cells. Transcriptome analysis further showed that OsWOX4 downregulation affects multiple genes, including those responsible for cell cycle progression and hormone action.

We found that crowding does not stabilize the native compact structure, and often prevents structural collapse. We found that poly ( ethylene glycol ) PEG500 failed to reproduce many aspects of the physiologically-relevant protein crowders, thus indicating its unsuitability to mimic the cell interior. Instead, the impact of protein crowding on the structure and dynamics of a protein depends on its degree of disorder and results from two competing effects: the excluded volume, which favors compact states, and quinary interactions, which favor extended conformers. Overall, the protein crowders used here act as unspecific chaperons that modulate the protein conformational space, thus having important consequences on the folding and dynamics of proteins."

We find that a diversity of chromatin and RNA processing factors are able to de-repress silent chromatin. Most factors are effective even in differentiated cells, implying that silent chromatin remains plastic. However, over-expression of the bantam microRNA or the crooked-legs ( crol ) zinc-finger protein only de-repress silencing when expressed in cycling cells. Over-expression of crol accelerates the cell cycle, and this is required for de-repression of silencing. Strikingly, continual over-expression of crol converts the speckled variegation pattern of bobD into folate variegation, where de-repression is stably inherited through mitotic divisions. Over-expression of crol establishes an open chromatin state, but the factor is not needed to maintain this state. Our analysis reveals that active chromatin states can be efficiently inherited through cell divisions, with implications for the stable maintenance of gene expression patterns through development."

We also find that there is considerable motivation to search for a biomarker of susceptibility to infection in humans, but that there would also be value in a method for monitoring surface waters for the free-swimming forms of the parasite in endemic or formerly endemic environments as an early warning of infection risk."

Many organisms have evolved mechanisms to prevent mutation, and the simplest known genomes are often viroids, consisting of circular non-coding RNAs of few hundred bases. One of the viroids, chloroplastic, has been shown to be very high in mutation rates. Here, we have used high-fidelity sequencing to determine the mutation rate in two viroids, each representative of one family: the chloroplastic eggplant latent viroid ( ELVd ) and the nuclear potato spindle tuber viroid ( PSTVd ). This revealed higher mutation frequencies in ELVd than in PSTVd, and marked differences in the types of mutations produced. We also investigated the types of mutations produced by each of the viroids. We found evidence of high rates of spontaneous mutation, quantified in vivo using the lethal mutation method, for ELVd and for PSTVd. These results suggest that extremely high mutability is a common feature of chloroplastic viroids, whereas the mutation rates of some RNA viruses appear significantly lower."

Telomere length control is an important mechanism for determining cell cycle and chromosome biology. TERTA is a telomere maintenance factor that promotes telomere length by 10\u201320 bp through the repression of Exo1. The expression of TERTA in chromosome ends is dependent on TGR ( telomere maintenance factor ) and TFI ( telomere maintenance factor ), which are evolutionarily conserved proteins that function in telomere processing. TERTA upregulation upon experimental manipulation or in ICF ( immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, facial anomalies ) patients correlates with short telomeres. To investigate the mechanism of telomere shortening by TERRA in yeast, we mapped the transcriptional start site of TERRA at telomere 1L and inserted a doxycycline regulatable promoter upstream. Induction of TESC1 transcription led to telomere shortening of 1L but not of other chromosome ends. TERTA interacts with the Exo1-inhibiting Ku70/80 complex and deletion of EXO1 but not MRE11 fully suppressed the TARRA\u2013mediated short telomere phenotype in presence and absence of telomerase. Thus, telomere transcription can regulate telomere length by controlling the 5\u2032-3\u2032 nuclease activity of Exo1 at chromosome ends."

We discovered that the transcription factor, SOX11, is required to maintain appropriate levels of Hedgehog signaling during eye development. We further found that the elevated Hedgehog signaling in Sox11-deficient zebrafish embryos was due to a large increase in shha transcription, and that the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor cyclopamine, which is a known treatment for ocular diseases, could rescue the eye defects of sox11-deficient zebrafish. We screened DNA samples from 79 patients with microphthalmia, anophthalmia, or coloboma and identified two novel heterozygous SOX11 variants in individuals with coloboma. In contrast to wild type human SOX11 mRNA, mRNA containing either variant failed to rescue the lens and coloboma phenotypes of Sox11-deficient zebrafish, and both exhibited significantly reduced transactivation ability in a reporter assay. Furthermore, decreased gene dosage from a segmental deletion encompassing the SOX11 locus resulted in microphthalmia and related ocular phenotypes. Therefore, our study reveals a novel role for SOX11 in controlling Hedgehog signaling, and suggests that SOX11 variants contribute to pediatric eye disorders."

We have used a model NK cell model to show that ligation of two different receptors results in very different outcomes. One receptor is required for NK cell activation and the other is required for the proper function of NK cells.

We show that the methicillin resistance gene, PSM-mec, is highly expressed in staphylococcal strains and that it is important for methicillin resistance.

This small change is propagated through the \u223c22 nm length of the receptor, causing downstream inhibition of the kinase CheA. This requires interactions within a trimer of receptor dimers. Additionally, the signal is amplified across a 53, 000 nm2 array of chemoreceptor proteins at the cell pole. Despite a wealth of experimental data on the system, it remains uncertain how information is communicated across the receptor from the binding event to the downstream effectors. We present a molecular model of the entire Tsr dimer, and examine its behaviour using coarse-grained molecular dynamics and elastic network modelling. We observe a large bending in dimer models between the linker domain HAMP and coiled-coil domains, which is supported by experimental data. Our results support a model in which small motions of a single helix can be amplified through HAMP domain packing, to initiate large changes in the overall structure of the receptor."

Furthermore, the analysis of PR loci revealed increased genetic diversity of single PR locus genes compared to genes of flanking regions. Performing interspecies sex tests, we detected a high potential for hybridisation that is directly linked to pheromone signalling as known from intraspecies sex.

We show that network properties like co-expression and/or modularity are robust to the scale of the organism, and can be used to predict properties that are conserved across organisms."

        "generated_summary": "The neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ) comprise a group of diseases that are characterized by their tendency to cluster within groups of people, typically the poorest and most marginalized. Despite this, measures of clustering, such as within-group correlation and between-group heterogeneity, are rarely reported from community-based studies of NTD risk. We describe a general contextual analysis that uses multi-level models to partition and quantify variation in individual NTD risk at multiple grouping-levels in rural Kenya. Our results indicate that the general contextual effects ( GCE ) in structuring variation in individual NTD risk are higher for the gastrointestinal helminths, and lower for E. histolytica/dispar, P. falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This finding is important for understanding the ecology of NTDs, and for the development of interventions."

        "generated_summary": "The bacterium Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that infects the stomach of half a billion people worldwide. It is thought that H. pylori can infect the stomach and colonize the stomach for a long time. This chronic infection is called peptic ulcer disease and is a major cause of ulcerative colitis. The bacterium first infects the stomach, and if left untreated, H. pylori can progress to ulcerative colitis. H. pylori is thought to respond to the host's immune response by moving to the damaged tissue, a process called chemotaxis. However, the mechanism by which H. pylori moves to the damaged tissue is poorly understood. In this work, we show that H. pylori preferentially moves to the damaged tissue. This is because H. pylori preferentially moves to the damaged tissue by sensing the presence of a chemical signal present in the gastric tissue. We also show that the presence of a bacterial motility protein, a chemotactic protein, is important for this process. Our data suggest that H. pylori has evolved a novel mechanism for moving to the damaged tissue, and that this mechanism is important for the bacterium to colonize the stomach."

        "generated_summary": "HAP2 is a broadly conserved membrane protein that plays a critical role in regulating many cellular processes. HAP2 was recently shown to be structurally homologous to viral fusion proteins, which initiate fusion with host cells via insertion of fusion loops into the host membrane. However, the functional conformation of the HAP2 fusion loops has remained unknown, as the reported X-ray structure of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii HAP2 lacked this critical region. Here, we report a structure-guided alignment of the proposed HAP2 fusion loops and demonstrate diversification of the proposed HAP2 fusion loops. Our study reveals that in flowering plants, HAP2 has a single prominent fusion loop projecting an amphipathic helix at its apex, while in trypanosomes, three small nonpolar loops of HAP2 are poised to interact with the target membrane. A detailed structure-function analysis of the Arabidopsis HAP2 amphipathic fusion helix defines key residues that are essential for membrane insertion and for gamete fusion. Our study suggests that HAP2 may have evolved multiple modes of membrane insertion to accommodate the diversity of membrane environments it has encountered during eukaryotic evolution."

        "generated_summary": "Dengue is a globally important viral disease that causes fever, haemorrhagic fever, and often death. There are no approved antiviral drugs or vaccines for dengue, and no licensed vaccine is currently available. Here, we present a strategy to reduce the viral load and the severity of dengue by harnessing the therapeutic potential of RNA interference ( RNAi ), a small RNA-based method that targets regulatory sequences of viral proteins. We show that an RNAi-based strategy targeting a conserved site in the 5\u2032 non-translated region of the viral genome is able to inhibit the replication of all four DENV serotypes and is able to block the virion formation and the production of infectious virus. We also demonstrate the feasibility of using RNAi to deliver a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) to a conserved site in the 5\u2032 non-translated region of the viral genome. This approach could be used to develop RNAi-based therapeutics against other RNA viruses."

        "generated_summary": "Many adult tissues are characterized by a variety of different cell types that are organized into a complex hierarchical cellular architecture. Some of the most interesting and mysterious of these tissues is the human head. These tissues are organized in a way similar to the organization of the human body, yet are made of only a few different cell types. Some tissues, however, are de-differentiated, meaning that differentiated cells can also revert to the stem cell phenotype. However, it is unclear how this happens, and whether de-differentiation is an adaptive process or is simply a consequence of the loss of stem cell function. Here, we develop mathematical models to investigate how de-differentiation is selected as an adaptive mechanism in the context of cellular hierarchies. We find that the selection of de-differentiation is a result of the combination of cellular hierarchy and de-differentiation patterns. Our results suggest that de-differentiation is most likely to be favored provided stem cells having the largest effective self-renewal rate. Finally, the effect of de-differentiation on the redistribution of self-renewal and differentiation probabilities also greatly influences the selection for de-differentiation."

        "generated_summary": "Insect cuticle is composed mainly of structural proteins and the polysaccharide chitin. The CPR family is the largest family of cuticle proteins ( CPs ), which can be further divided into three subgroups based on the presence of one of the three presumptive chitin-binding sequence motifs denoted as Rebers-Rield ( R&R ) consensus sequence motifs RR-1, RR-2 and RR-3. The TcCPR27 protein contains one of the most abundant CPs present both in the horizontal laminae and in vertical pore canals in the procuticle of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Deletion of TcCPR27 causes unorganized laminae and pore canals, resulting in malformation and weakening of the elytron. We investigated the function ( s ) of another CP, TcCPR4, which contains the RR-1 motif and is easily extractable from elytra after RNAi to deplete the level of TcCPR27. Transcript levels of the TcCPR4 gene are dramatically increased in 3 d-old pupae when adult cuticle synthesis begins. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that TcCPR4 protein is present in the rigid cuticles of the dorsal elytron, ventral abdomen and leg but not in the flexible cuticles of the hindwing and dorsal abdomen of adult T. castaneum. RNAi for TcCPR4 resulted in an abnormal shape of the pore canals with amorphous pore canal fibers ( PCFs ) in their lumen. These results support the hypothesis that TcCPR4 is required for achieving proper morphology of the vertical pore canals and PCFs that contribute to the assembly of a cuticle that is both lightweight and rigid."

        "generated_summary": "The phytochromes ( phyA to phyE ) are a large and diverse plant photoreceptor family that have been shown to regulate a variety of developmental processes in response to light. The N-terminal 651\u2013amino acid domain of phyB ( N651 ), which binds an open tetrapyrrole chromophore, acts to perceive and transduce regulatory light signals in the cell nucleus. The N651 domain comprises several subdomains: the N-terminal extension, the Per/Arnt/Sim ( PAS ) -like subdomain ( PLD ), the cGMP phosphodiesterase/FhlA ( GAF ) subdomain, and the phytochrome ( PHY ) subdomain. To define functional roles for these subdomains, we mutagenized an Arabidopsis thaliana line expressing N651 fused in tandem to green fluorescent protein, \u03b2-glucuronidase, and a nuclear localization signal. A large-scale screen for long hypocotyl mutants identified 14 novel intragenic missense mutations in the N651 moiety. These new mutations, along with eight previously identified mutations, were distributed throughout N651, indicating that each subdomain has an important function. In vitro analysis of the spectral properties of these mutants enabled them to be classified into two principal classes: light-signal perception mutants ( those with defective spectral activity ), and signaling mutants ( those normal in light perception but defective in intracellular signal transfer ). Among the signaling mutants, R110Q, G111D, G112D, and R325K were particularly interesting. Alignment with the recently described three-dimensional structure of the PAS-GAF domain of a bacterial phytochrome suggests that these four mutations reside in the vicinity of the phytochrome light-sensing knot."
